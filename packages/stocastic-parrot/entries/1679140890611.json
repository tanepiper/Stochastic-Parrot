This can be used for malicious purposes such as spreading misinformation, damaging reputations, manipulating elections, and creating non-consensual pornography.\n\nAnother example includes developing autonomous weapons systems that could harm humans without human intervention. These machines have the potential to decide who lives and dies on the battlefield, removing ethical considerations from important life-and-death decisions.\n\nUsing AI in surveillance technologies may also infringe upon the privacy rights of individuals by tracking their movements and activities without their knowledge or consent.\n\nAI can also be utilized to manipulate public opinion through disinformation campaigns. By creating fake social media accounts or chatbots that spread false information or promote extremist views,\n\nPeople may employ biased algorithms in hiring practices leading to discrimination against certain demographics based on age, race, gender among other factors during job application processes; thus exacerbating inequality within society at large scale level"
