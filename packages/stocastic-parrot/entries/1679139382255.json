You would have to disassemble the machine, remove the internal components related to the brewing system, and create a new way for water to be poured manually over coffee grounds in a filter. \n\nHowever, this is not recommended as it will void any warranties on your Keurig machine and may lead to damage or malfunction if not done correctly. Additionally, there are many pour-over coffee makers available on the market that are designed specifically for this brewing method and may provide better results."
