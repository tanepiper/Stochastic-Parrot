Kind regards/Best regards: A more casual but still respectful option, suitable for most business correspondence.\n3. Yours faithfully: Suitable when addressing someone you don't know well in a formal context.\n4. Yours sincerely/Yours truly: Works well when you have established rapport with the recipient during previous communications.\n5. Best/All the best: A friendly closing that works well in informal settings or between colleagues who know each other well.\n\nDepending on your relationship with the recipient, you may choose different phrases to convey various sentiments at the end of your message before signing off:\n\n- Warmest wishes\n- Thanks and have a great day\n- Looking forward to hearing from you\n\nRemember to include your name (and job title if applicable) after whichever sign-off phrase you choose!"
