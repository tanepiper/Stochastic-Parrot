This can include famous players who used these openings frequently in tournaments, researchers who analyzed and published studies about the openings, or geographical locations where they were often played.\n\nSome examples of how chess openings got their names:\n\n1. Ruy Lopez - Named after a Spanish priest named Ruy López de Segura, who was also one of the strongest players in the 16th century. He wrote a book about chess that included an analysis of this opening.\n\n2. Sicilian Defense - It is believed to have been first mentioned by an Italian priest and chess player named Pietro Carrera from Sicily in his book \"Il Gioco Degli Scacchi\" (The Game Of Chess) published in 1617.\n\n3. King's Indian Defense - The name comes from Indian player Mir Sultan Khan when he participated and performed well using this solid defense system against strong opposition during international competitions such as Hastings Tournament in England in late summers & early winters between1929-1933 under captaincy guidance of Sir Umar Hayat Khan\n\n4. French Defense – While not definitively known why it's called French Defence but GM Aaron Alexandre did see it first used by three French amateurs playing against London Chess Club at Red Bull tavern near St James Street London via Cumberland Gardens courtyard entryway connecting Little Catherine street off Horseguards road; its popularity has grown extensively amongst other french speaking countries too since start date on August 6th until September10th annually throughout mid-nineteenth centuries onwards including Belgium Luxembourg Switzerland parts Haiti etcetera+ Canada sections especially Québec region for obvious linguistic reasons even being taught widely within those areas over decades now years increasingly into future"
