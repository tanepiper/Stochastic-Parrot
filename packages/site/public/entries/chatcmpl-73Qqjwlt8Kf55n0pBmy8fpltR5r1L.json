Improved heart health\nA plant-based diet tends to be lower in saturated fats and higher in fiber, which can reduce the risk of heart disease. Moreover, it is rich in antioxidants and other nutrients that promote healthy blood vessels.\n\n2. Lower cancer risk\nDiets high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains have been linked with a lower risk of certain types of cancer.\n\n3. Better weight management \nPlant-based diets are often lower in calories than diets centered on animal products and may lead to weight loss or help maintain a healthy body weight.\n\n4. Prevention or better control of diabetes\nResearch suggests that people who follow a predominantly plant-based diet have a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes compared to those consuming higher amounts of animal proteins.\n\n5. Improved digestion\nHigh intakes of fruit, vegetables, legumes and whole grains - all staples within plant based diets- equate to an increased fiber consumption offering assistance toward bowel regularity & prevention from numerous digestive issues including constipation & irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\n6.Positive environmental impact:\nWhen large portions make up consumption come from plants rather than livestock there is significantly less contribution towards negative impacts such as deforestation & greenhouse gas emissions on our environment\n\n7.Cruelty-free lifestyle choices:\nFor ethical reasons; primarily concerning moral consideration for creatures harboring consciousness opting for alternative dietary direction allows us freedom by promoting welfare within the farming industries through reductions in demand whilst ultimately demanding healthier practices across food chains"
