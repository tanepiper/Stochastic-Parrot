They do not consider any other being or object worthy of worship.\n\nHowever, the crescent symbol has been associated with Islam for historical reasons. It is thought that this connection dates back to early Islamic history when Muslim lands saw cultural influence from Byzantine Empire which used crescent symbols on their flags and coins.\n\nThe association between Islam and the crescent got stronger during Ottoman times when it appeared on Turkish flags representing the Ottomans - a predominantly Muslim empire.\n\nToday, the star and crescent symbol are often seen on flags of Muslim-majority countries and Islamic organizations but it should be noted that those visual representations are cultural markers rather than objects Muslims pray to or direct their faith towards."
