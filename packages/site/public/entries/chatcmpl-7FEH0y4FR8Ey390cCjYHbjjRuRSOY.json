Some key components that makeup AI include machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, robotics, expert systems, speech recognition, planning and scheduling systems.\n\n1. Machine Learning: It is a core component of AI that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Popular techniques within this field include supervised learning algorithms like regression and classification models; unsupervised approaches such as clustering or anomaly detection; reinforcement learning methods for decision-making tasks; and deep learning using neural networks.\n\n2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP allows machines to understand human language by extracting meaning from big volumes of text data in order to answer queries or complete missions efficiently. Techniques that often underpin NLP technology range from syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis to named entity recognition and question-answering systems.\n\n3. Computer Vision: This branch deals with enabling computers to perceive visual information effectively via image processing algorithms or machine-based video analyses designed for object identification/recognition purposes typically employed in self-driving cars security surveillance operations amongst others.\n\n4. Robotics: It focuses on designing robots capable of numerous activities including locomotion perception manipulation etc these autonomous machines integrate multiple technologies like machine-learning behaviors motor control sensors navigational abilities depending upon desired outcomes specific missions undertaken varying industries scenario environments experienced along pathway achievements traversed hence optimised effectiveness resourcefulness maximises potential performance gains comfortably accurately demonstrably achieving goals higher degrees success prowess substantial contributions worthwhile advances promising progress era advancement radically improves paradigm experience perspective evolution deliverance efficacies implemented iteratively consistently diligently concerted endeavours strategically aligning aims targets singular cooperative cohesive integrated coordinated centralised operation system platform"
