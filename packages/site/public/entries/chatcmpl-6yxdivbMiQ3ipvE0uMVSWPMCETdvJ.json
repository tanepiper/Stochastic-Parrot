Google Text-to-Speech (Android):\n- Go to Settings > Accessibility > Text-to-speech output.\n- Select Google Text-to-speech as your preferred engine.\n- Adjust other settings, such as Speech rate and Pitch, as desired.\n- If an app specifically supports Google's text-to-speech feature, look for a \"Read Aloud\" button within the app.\n\n2. Apple iOS (iPhone/iPad):\n- Go to Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Speak Selection or Speak Screen\n- Turn on Speak Selection or Speak Screen depending on your needs.\n  - With Speak Selection enabled, select the text that you want to convert into speech; this will cause a new menu option labeled 'Speak' to appear above it.\n  - Speak Screen is best used with single-page content like articles and notes; once toggled from Control Center, it reads everything visible in order without needing users' manual navigation\n\n3. Windows Operating System:\nMicrosoft provides built-in options on Windows OS called Narrator which can read out loud any available content but they also work well with Microsoft Edge browser offering immersive reading experience: -*-\n   * Press Start Button & type \"Narrator.\" Click it when found +:+|;\n    OR.LayoutControlItem_Handle>>();\n"
