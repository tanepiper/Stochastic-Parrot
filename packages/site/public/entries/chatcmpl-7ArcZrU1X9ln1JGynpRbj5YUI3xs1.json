Find how many cycles are necessary:\n60 ÷ 12 ≈ <<60/12=5>>5\nWe find that it's not enough for him to complete just four cycles because with them he would be able to catch only: \n\n4 (cycles) × 12fish = <<4*12=48>>48fish – which is less than what we need.\n\nTherefore our answer here is five cycles;\n\n2. Find out how many days those five cycles will take :\nEach cycle has four days;\nThus:\n\nNumber_of_days_for_fishing_catch_ Fish ≥ Number_of_cycles×(days_in_each_cycle)≥  \nDays≥_Length_of_interval−1 ;\nThe length of interval L=fish_rate *(the number_of_days_on +the_number _of_days_off). So in our case :\n\nDays≥60-1+ [(5 )(complete_duration_period)];\n\nHowever for convenience ,we may notice that; since within each full_complete week duration period consists exactly \na_frame_time =(4×)(number_working_shift)=[(number_day/week)-((active_working/saturday)][experimental_direction_set]\n#=3minute_greeting\n\nThen using as part_counter_bits ;usually this value could perhaps be"
