However, they have distinct meanings and shouldn't be confused with each other.\n\nLength typically refers to the longest straight line distance between two points on an object. It often measures the horizontal extent of a flat surface like a table or piece of fabric, but it can also apply to elongated objects such as sticks, boxes, and vehicles.\n\nHeight, on the other hand, usually indicates vertical distance â€“ how tall something is from its base (lowest point) up to its top (highest point). Height pertains specifically to buildings, trees, mountains or even people.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Length represents how long something is horizontally.\n- Height signifies how high something stands vertically."
