Achieving better outcomes: Negotiation can lead to a mutually beneficial outcome that satisfies both parties, allowing each side to gain value from the agreement.\n\n2. Exercising decision-making power and influence: Through negotiation, each participant has the opportunity to express their views and interests, making decisions together that consider everyone's needs.\n\n3. Building relationships: A successful negotiation fosters goodwill and understanding between all involved parties, leading to stronger working relationships for future collaboration or partnerships.\n\n4. Aligning expectations: Clear communication during negotiations helps ensure that all parties have a shared understanding of what they are agreeing upon, reducing misunderstandings later on related project work or contractual obligations.\n\n5. Saving costs and resources: Effective negotiation strategies can result in cost savings by finding compromises where both sides make concessions while ensuring essential requirements aren't compromised.\n\n6. Avoiding disputes and conflicts: Open discussions about expectations during negotiation reduces potential disagreements down the line as plans progress; this helps avoid costly litigation battles or damaged reputations stemming from broken contracts due to miscommunication.\n\n7.
