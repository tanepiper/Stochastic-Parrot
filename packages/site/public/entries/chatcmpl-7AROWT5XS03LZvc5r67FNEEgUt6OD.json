It is usually calculated as the difference between births and deaths, plus any net migration that may occur.\n\nThere are several factors that contribute to positive (growth) or negative (decline) country population growth rates:\n\n1. Birth rates: The main contributor to population growth is an increase in the number of live births per year. A higher birth rate means more people are being born, contributing positively to overall population size.\n\n2. Death rates: Conversely, death rates also have a significant impact on a country's population size â€“ if more people die than are born each year, it results in fewer individuals and thus contributes negatively towards total numbers.\n\n3. Immigration/Emigration: Migration can either be positive or negative; depending on whether more individuals immigrate into the nation (coming from another country) or emigrate out of it. This greatly influences overall changes regarding demographics for both originating locations and destinations alike.\n\n4. Access to healthcare services: Countries with better access tend to have lower mortality/death rates due as their citizens obtain necessary medical care quickly leading fewer diseases remaining untreated potentially reducing fatalities across all age groups leading upto increased life expectancy further increasing total national residents residing presently there!\n\n5 Economic opportunities & political stability: Individuals often relocate when job offers arise requiring them travel seeking work abroad helping family members back home sending monetary portions earned assisting develop those regions too experiencing conflict/unrest often move away actually preferring safer refuge options so many cases war torn countries seriously suffer depopulation effects unless they internally resettle provinces nation itself near vicinity where industrial projects commence/by foreign investments injecting capital generating employment throughout areas involved themselves.\n \nCountries such Indonesia India witnessed massive increases particularly"
