Greenhouse gases: Human activities such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), deforestation, and agriculture release large quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun's rays within the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures.\n\n2. Aerosols: Industrial processes also emit aerosols or tiny particles into the air that can have either warming or cooling effects on the Earth's climate. However, their net effect is still uncertain.\n\n3. Deforestation: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air during photosynthesis; when trees are cut down or burned, they release stored CO2 back into the environment. This contributes to increased atmospheric CO2 levels amplifying temperature rises caused by other sources of emissions.\n\n4. Land use changes: Conversion of forests to agricultural land can cause climate change due to reduced albedo (the amount of sunlight reflected by surfaces) and through increased carbon emissions resulting from biomass decomposition.\n\n5. Solar radiation fluctuations: The intensity of solar energy reaching Earth fluctuates across various time scales — ranging from an 11-year solar cycle up to longer-term variations lasting thousands of years— which may contribute modestly toward relative warming or cooling trends on regional scales over those timespans.\n\n6.Charting natural variability amplified with man-made pressure– Volcanic eruptions remain a factor contributing naturally occurring aerosol production coupled with widespread short-term cooling events following explosive volcanic activity owing primarily sulfur dioxide conversion prompting sulfate aerosols reflecting upward radiations outward away from earth’s surface thereby inducing cooler conditions until their gradual disintegration after a few months pass post eruption\n\n7.Animation-Responsible Agricultural practises-Increasing sections"
