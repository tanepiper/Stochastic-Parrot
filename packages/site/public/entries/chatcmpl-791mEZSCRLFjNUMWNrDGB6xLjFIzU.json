        "content": "DisplayPort is indeed better than HDMI in various aspects such as higher maximum bandwidth, support for daisy-chaining multiple monitors with a single connection, and native support for variable refresh rates. \n\n1. Higher Bandwidth: DisplayPort supports more significant data transfer rates (up to 32.4 Gbps) compared to even the latest versions of HDMI (2.1 with up to 48Gbps). This translates into higher resolutions, color depths, and refresh rates.\n\n2. Daisy-Chaining Capabilities: A single DisplayPort cable can be used to connect multiple monitors without using extra adapters or connections which makes it easier to manage cables in workstations or gaming setups.\n\n3. Variable Refresh Rate Support: While some new versions of HDMI come with built-in VRR features like FreeSync technology from AMD, DisplayPort has supported these features natively since its inception.\n\n4. Lower Latency: Although both technologies handle input lag well when comparing equal standard levels (for instance DP 1.4 vs HDMI 2.o), generally speaking Displayport maintains marginally lower latency between the two types - this might be an essential factor depending on what your intention is whilst using either cable option (gaming).\n\n5 . More Audio Channels Supported\n\n6 . Better Support For HDR Displays"
