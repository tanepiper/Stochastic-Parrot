However, the popular concept of 10,000 hours suggests that with approximately this amount of time invested in practice and study, one can achieve a high level of proficiency or expertise in their chosen skill or subject.\n\nThis theory was introduced by neurologist Daniel Levitin but made famous by Malcolm Gladwell in his book \"Outliers.\" Keep in mind that these numbers are approximations; some people may need more time while others might need less. In addition to the commitment of time and effort, other factors like innate talent, quality instruction or guidance from mentors/teachers also play a major role."
