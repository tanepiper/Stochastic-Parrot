However, if you want to find an email in Gmail with specific content such as \"CV\", you can use the search bar at the top of your Gmail account and type \"CV\" (without quotes) before pressing Enter.\n\nYou can also try advanced search options by clicking on the small downward-pointing arrow on the right side of the search bar. Here, you can add more filters like sender's email address, date range, attachments availability, etc., to refine your search results.\n\nRemember that while searching for emails in any mail service including Gmail itâ€™s always important not to share personal information publicly or with untrusted sources due to privacy concerns."
