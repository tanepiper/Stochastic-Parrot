In this process, webmasters try to persuade other websites with valuable inbound links pointing at outdated or unavailable URLs to replace those links with updated or relevant pages on the same site. This helps redirect traffic and authority from the old URLs to new ones, which boosts a website's overall SEO (Search Engine Optimization) status.\n\nWhen sites update content or implement rebranding strategies, they may move some page locations without providing proper redirects for users who visit through old link pathways. Over time, these unattended broken or outdated links can negatively impact SEO because search engines value authoritative \"backlinks\" as an indicator of quality and validity when ranking pages in their results.\n\nTherefore, redirect amplification works towards discovering these missed opportunities and convincing reciprocal site owners to amend specific hyperlinks within their content so that any corresponding influence acquired by connecting domains can be retained going forward into subsequent iterations of updated material â€“ thus improving both parties' online relevancy measures accordingly."
