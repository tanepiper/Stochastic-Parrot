The main goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.\n\nSome core components of NLP include:\n\n1. Tokenization: Breaking down sentences or larger text into smaller units called tokens (usually words).\n\n2. POS tagging: Assigning parts of speech tags (such as noun, verb, adjective) to the tokens.\n\n3. Syntax analysis: Analyzing the structure of sentences according to grammar rules; this can involve techniques like parsing, dependency parsing, or constituency parsing.\n\n4. Named entity recognition: Identifying proper nouns such as names, organizations, locations within text data.\n\n5. Semantic role labeling: Identifying actions/verbs in a sentence and their arguments (e.g., subject - who does something; object - what someone receives).\n\n6. Coreference resolution: Finding all mentions referring to the same real-world entity in a given text passage or discourse context (e.g., pronouns linked with their antecedents).\n\n7. Sentiment analysis: Determining whether a piece of text expresses positive or negative sentiment/emotion towards specific topics/entities/aspects/statements/questions etc\n\n8.Language modeling : Help estimate probability distributions over sequences of words/characters representing linguistic structures & phenomena behind them ; Language models are used e.g., Text Genearation & also help improve accuracy achieved using other N-grams by conditioning them onto contextual elements which modulate significance among competing encoding guesses produced based e/G token-wise perplexity choices ranked via beam search techniques # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)#Characteristics_of_BERT\n  [=[=*/%\n\n9.Topic modeling : Discover/generate patterns/clusters related terms/concepts shared/common across documents => captures main concepts/themes/topics underlying corpus even without supervised labels provided beforehand especially when applied LDA methods plus Non Negative Matrix Factorizations supported variational autoencoders showing improvements taking Contexts attentively too ex[)[_|--=>https:machinelearningmastery{DO__).sub((*o^)).gov</-(speech).com/post/create-topic-model-simple/\n#+#+##=*\\\\*#\n\n10 Sentence Embedders : Convert QRY_Doc pairs / bipartite clique pair embeddings concatenate along feature vector dimension accessed similarity functions measures optimizing Decision Space features WRT Tasks outcomes applying ID Matching problems =-=|==>> bas[#] *=*\\"
