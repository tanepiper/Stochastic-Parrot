        "content": "There are no exact studies mentioning how much NAD+ we need per day, as individual needs for nutrients and cofactors like NAD+ vary based on factors such as age, genetics, diet, lifestyle choices and overall health.\n\nHowever, to support the body's natural processes that require NAD+, it is essential to consume a balanced diet rich in the precursors or building blocks of NAD+. Some key dietary sources of these precursors include:\n\n1. Nicotinamide (niacinamide): This form of vitamin B3 can be found in foods like fish (tuna and salmon), chicken breast, turkey meat, breakfast cereals fortified with niacin or supplements.\n\n2. Tryptophan: An essential amino acid most notably found in protein-rich foods such as turkey, chicken,tofu,eggs milk cheese , pumpkin seeds nuts and legumes\n\n3. Nicotinic Acid (NA)or aka niacin: Vitamin B3 which can be found from animal-based food items containing liver,turkey,pork,chicken,and some plantbased items like mushrooms,wheat bran,brown rice,nuts,endive.Avocado \n\nIt's important to note that excessive intake of certain nutrients might have harmful effects; therefore,it is always best"
