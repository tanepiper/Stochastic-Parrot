Overpopulation: Urban areas tend to attract more people due to better job opportunities, access to quality education and healthcare facilities, modern lifestyle, and more cultural activities. This leads to overcrowding, which puts a strain on public services such as transportation, housing, sanitation, sewage disposal systems among others.\n\n2. High cost of living: The influx of people into urban areas can increase the demand for limited resources like housing or food leading to increased prices making it difficult for low-income earners or those who live below poverty lines.\n\n3. Environmental pollution: With increasing populations in cities comes an inevitably higher demand for energy consumption resulting in air pollution from industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust fumes contributing significantly to global warming phenomena like climate change while also affecting human health through respiratory ailments stemming from poor air quality exposure over time including potential exacerbation chronic conditions such asthma etcetera+.
