Identify and isolate the species involved: Evaluate what plants or animals are suffering from problems in your area, including potential invasive species or threats to their existence.\n\n2. Research ecological requirements: Determine which environmental factors affect the growth, reproduction, and survival of each species involved (e.g., water temperature for fish).\n\n3. Develop habitat maps: Overlay data on land use history, floodplains/floodways, vegetation cover types, existing disturbance levels (pests/diseases/status), and other physical attributes on topographic maps to identify opportunities for restoration projects.\n\n4. Assess nutrient impacts: Calculate nutrient inputs (nitrogen/phosphorus/sediments) from land uses within the watershed(s) using models such as GIS tools; prioritize efforts based on pollutant loads at critical points throughout the river/stream system.\n\n5.
