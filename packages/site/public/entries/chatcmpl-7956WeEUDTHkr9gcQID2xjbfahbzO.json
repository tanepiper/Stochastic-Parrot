Still, these terms don't strictly imply that they actively practice any type of religious belief or prayer associated specifically with malicious entities like demons.\n\nThe term \"demonolatry\" refers specifically to rituals and beliefs centered around demonic spirits. A person who practices these rites may also be referred to as a demonolater."
