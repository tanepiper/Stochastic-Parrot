Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible tokens where each token holds the same value, non-fungible tokens have distinct values and attributes.\n\nExamples of NFTs include:\n\n1. Digital artwork: Artists can create unique pieces of art in digital form, represented by an NFT. Ownership rights to the artwork can then be bought and sold via platforms like OpenSea and Rarible.\n\n2. Collectibles: Virtual collectibles such as trading cards, video game characters or items, pets, stickers etc., each with its own unique traits and characteristics represented by an associated NFT.\n\n3. Domain names: Some blockchain-based domain registration services allow you to purchase decentralized domain names represented as NFTs on a specific blockchain.\n\n4.Team autograph/photo(Card\"): Similar to traditional sports memorabilia here users would get access limited edition team photo/card signed by players \n\n5.Virtual real estate â€“ Some virtual world environments like Decentraland require purchasing land parcels using their respective native currency but also offers  an accompanying in-game LAND itemized as an ERC-721 Non-Fungable Token\n\n6.Event tickets -Using Blockchain technology for event validation could help control ticket scalping/frauds moreover providing completely transparent process \n\n\nIn sum ,Nft's present  wide scope/utility  offering individuality & uniqueness (scarce quantity) ranging from art ownership till smart contracts/partnerships ."
