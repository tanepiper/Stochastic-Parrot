Give them a strong motivation: Like any other character, villains should have clear goals and motivations that drive their actions. This could be revenge, power, greed or even twisted love.\n\n2. Develop a deep backstory: Your villain's past experiences should shape who they are as an antagonist in your story. Make sure to develop their history so that readers can see how they became the person they are today.\n\n3. Create complexity: Memorable villains usually aren't purely evil - they often have some redeeming characteristics or complex motives that make them more interesting and relatable.\n\n4. Connect the villain with the hero/protagonist: The best antagonists usually have some kind of personal connection with the protagonist(s). This will help create tension and further conflict between these characters\n\n5.SIGNS OF A_GOOD_AGENT_FONT_WRAP_about_boundaries_and_structure__EN.svg.png 6.endations_designed_for_a_scholarship_letter_of_inte_or_font_wrap_ideal_client_d.swithliances,_mutual_respect_or_successful.outcome_.svg.pngly:_No_one_likes_to_read_about_a_villain_that_always_gets_caught_easily._To_make_yo_urantagonist_compelling,_have_them_be_cunning_and_smarter_than_others_give_th _emthe.upper_hand.in.some.situations..\n\n6.Make.them.scary._Dont.be.afraid_to.create.real.menace.with.your.villain.__Cra __ftthesense.of.dread.and.imagery.to.arealnightmare._\n\n7_Give_the_nutritious..your.story.world...Make"
