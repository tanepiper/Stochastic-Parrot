        "content": "Some potential disadvantages of using nuclear energy include:\n\n1. Radioactive waste: One of the major concerns with nuclear power plants is the generation and disposal of radioactive waste, which remains hazardous for thousands of years. There are no long-term solutions currently in place to manage this waste.\n\n2. Accidents and safety concerns: In rare cases, accidents at nuclear power plants can have disastrous consequences like Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima Daiichi (2011). These disasters resulted in significant loss of life, environmental damage, and public fear about the safety of nuclear energy.\n\n3. High costs: The construction and operation cost associated with a new nuclear power plant is high when compared to other alternative means such as solar or wind power. Additionally, decommissioning an old plant can be extremely expensive.\n\n4. Limited resources: Nuclear reactors require uranium to generate electricity; unfortunately, uranium supplies are finite while renewable energies are unlimited by nature resources.\n\n5- Proliferation risks: Some nations may access civilian technology acquired for peaceful purposes but use them clandestinely to develop weapons capabilities increasing geopolitical tensions\n\n6- Environmental damage from mining operations: Uranium extraction process often causes deforestation water pollution air degradation contaminating communities close those areas affecting human health wildlife habitat\n\n7- Security Risks Terrorists attacks deliberate sabotage facilities causing leakage meltdowns must consider securing operating sites adequately against extreme scenarios including theft transport material possessing warhead components"
