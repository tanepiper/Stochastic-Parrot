My knowledge comes from the data that has been trained up until September 2021, so any new information will not be available to me unless it is added in future updates. However, if you want something related to empathy and feelings explained or discussed on this platform, feel free to ask questions about those topics and I will do my best to provide informative answers based on research done by real people."
