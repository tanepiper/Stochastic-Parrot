Covert operations typically involve extensive planning and may include surveillance, espionage, sabotage, propaganda dissemination, undercover work, and various forms of deception to conceal their true purpose.\n\nIn simple terms: A covert operation is like playing hide-and-seek in the real world. Some group (usually a government agency) has an objective they want to accomplish discreetly by using spies or agents who perform actions on their behalf behind the scenes without drawing attention to themselves."
