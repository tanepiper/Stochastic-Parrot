Python: Known for its readability and simplicity, Python is often recommended as an excellent first language to learn.\n2. JavaScript: Because it's mainly used in web development, JavaScript has a gentle learning curve and provides instant visual feedback on your work.\n3. Ruby: Often praised for its elegance and expressiveness, Ruby can be a great option when starting out in programming.\n\nHarder languages:\n\n1. C++: A powerful but complex language known for its steep learning curve; mastering it requires time, patience and strong problem-solving skills.\n2. Java: Although versatile, Java can be harder to grasp due to its verbose syntax compared to other high-level languages like Python or Ruby.\n3. Assembly Language (ASM): This low-level programming language close to machine code demands deep understanding of computer architecture making it significantly more difficult than higher-level alternatives.\n\nOf course, the perceived difficulty of each language may vary depending on individual learning styles and prior experience with coding concepts - this is not an exhaustive list nor universally true ranking!"
