        "content": "Create a smart thermostat that is capable of learning from the temperature preferences, occupancy patterns, and schedule of its users. The thermostat must be compatible with different heating and cooling systems and should be Wi-Fi enabled.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Temperature control: Instead of simply following predefined schedules for raising or lowering temperatures, the thermostat will adjust temperatures based on actual habits and routines by adapting to the user's preferred temperature during specific times of day or week.\n\n2. Energy saving: Provide an energy savings mode that adjusts HVAC settings when no one is at home, reducing energy costs without compromising comfort.\n\n3. Occupancy sensing: Sense when people are frequently in certain rooms and prioritize those areas for temperature regulation. Additionally, adjust temperature settings automatically when occupants are away from home for extended periods (e.g., vacations).\n\n4. Automatic scheduling: Automatically learn new schedules as necessary if there's a change in your routine (i.e., adjusting accordingly if you start waking up earlier/later than usual), eliminating the need for manual reprogramming.\n\n5. Weather tracking integration: Monitor local weather conditions to better predict how long it may take to heat/cool your residence based on outside factors like humidity levels and climate differences throughout each season â€“ particularly useful in transitional times between winter/spring/fall fluctuations.\n\n6. Compatibility & connectivity: Compatible with various HVAC systems such as gas furnaces, air conditioning units, radiant floor systems while offering wireless connectivity through Wi-Fi technology so you can control everything via mobile app regardless if you're at home itself or miles away remotely accessing its features anywhere around globe within measurable ranges using internet connected devices including smartphones/tablets/computers etc!\n\n7. Mobile app supportludes options allowing precise manipulation over thermostatic processes either automatically controlled alone according programmed instructions set"
