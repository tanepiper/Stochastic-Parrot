Relatability: People often become attached to characters they find relatable or who share similar experiences, struggles, or personality traits.\n\n2. Idealization: Fiction allows authors and creators to build their ideal version of a character - one that is intelligent, attractive and the epitome of ideals people crave.\n\n3. Wish fulfillment: Often times these fictional characters possess qualities that are desired in real-life partners – see point 2 about idealization\n\n4.Foundation building: As you invest time into reading/watching/listening-to the story where this character comes from, you start rooting/cheering for this entity (romantic partner or not).\n\n5.Connection & imagination strengthening : In the world of fiction one has a most dangerous mechanism called \"subtext\"- people start interpreting intentions/goals/virtues on their own; leading way-too-often infatuations.The beauty (or curse) is within your mind which romanticizes and fantasizes them doing more than what’s written about/on screen(like they interact with just you). \n\nIt's important to remember that there's nothing wrong with being attracted to a fictional character as long as it doesn't affect your everyday life duties or take over any chance of forming relationships/social circle within real life beings.\n"
