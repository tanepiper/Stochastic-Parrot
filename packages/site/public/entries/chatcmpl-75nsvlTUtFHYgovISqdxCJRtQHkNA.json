        "content": "Now that microplastics have been found in fruits and vegetables, they may be affecting our metabolism by entering into the cells.\n\nMicroplastics are tiny fragments of plastic (less than 5mm) that come from larger plastic products broken down over time. They can get absorbed by plants through their roots and end up in the edible parts which we consume.\n\nTo understand how consuming these microplastic particles could affect human health, it is essential to recognize their interaction with metabolic processes inside the body. While a concrete explanation of how exactly they interact with our metabolism is still being researched upon, some theories suggest that:\n\n1. Inflammation: Upon ingestion of microplastics, an immune response may follow as foreign materials interacting with the intestines lead to inflammation. This inflammation can result in disrupted hormonal balance important for regulating metabolism.\n   \n2. Hormonal disruptions: Microplastics might leak toxic compounds like Bisphenol A (BPA), which is known to disrupt hormones such as estrogen and influence diverse aspects of cellular function impacting overall metabolic regulation.\n\n3. Oxidative stress: The buildup of free radicals due to microplastic particles has been linked to oxidative stress on a cellular level resulting in alterations within cell functions including DNA damage or even apoptosis (cell death). Such structural changes inside cells hinder adequate functioning in energy production thus negatively influencing metabolism.\n        \n4.Intestinal microbiota alteration: There's potential for ingested microplastics to disturb our gut bacteria composition which plays an integral part regarding digestion absorption control ultimately shaping host organism metabolisms\n\nThese factors contribute towards modifications concerning lipid storage glucose homeostasis protein turnover thermogenesis â€“ basically every aspect related normal physiologic process requires food conversion then storage/release after consumption"
