It intensifies the frequency and severity of extreme weather events - such as hurricanes, heatwaves, floods and droughts.\n\nSome specific impacts are:\n\n1. Rising sea levels: As glaciers in polar regions melt due to increasing land temperatures or rising oceanic heat content cause thermal expansion of water (as it warms), global sea levels rise. This threatens habitats for marine life as well as folks living on coastlines worldwide which could lead to flooding or coastal erosion that eventually forces people out of their homes.\n\n2. Extreme Weather Events: Higher surface temperatures exacerbate extreme situations such as intense storms with heavier rainfall leading to flash flooding causing damage to agriculture and infrastructure in affected areas (and indirectly contributing excess nutrients back into water sources); increased drought frequencies also negatively impact crop yields making less affordable foods available reducing access availability; longer-lasting heatwaves with higher maximum daily temperature values resulting record summer highs affect elderly individuals who live alone at risk severe dehydration putting more pressure emergency services coping assistance demands timely manner during these periods extended demand strain national healthcare systems possible danger-of-life given prolonged exposure high likelihood respiratory illness development adult population; stronger hurricanes bringing devastating consequences humanitarian necessities immediate need cleanup restoration after-effects typhoon destruction superstorms forming from warming planet atmosphere including uprooted trees threatening existing construction projects major road blockages preventing timely delivery aid replenishments evacuees return properties damaged by sustained winds torrential downpours contaminated drinking-water supplies unsafe swimming conditions closed fisheries polluted streams river bodies inland location deterioration quality through excessive surface run-off poor sanitation methods exacerbation floodables\n\n3.
