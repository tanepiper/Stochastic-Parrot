This could help to determine the most ethically sound course of action.\n\nSome ways AI might improve ethical decision-making include:\n\n1. Impartiality: Artificial intelligence is unbiased as it does not carry any personal preferences or emotions that might cloud its judgment.\n\n2. Consistency: AI systems can provide consistent outputs every time they perform a task if given the same inputs over different situations\n\n3. Speed and efficiency: When dealing with large amounts of data or complex analytical tasks, AI systems are able to process them at high speed compared to humans\n\n4. Predictive capabilities: Machine learning algorithms can make predictions based on vast historical data sets; these predictions can offer input for better-informed decisions about potential implications\n\n5. Customizable ethical frameworks: AI tools may allow stakeholders to input their \"rules\" or guidelines representing their moral beliefs or organizational values â€” then the system applies those rules when making decisions alongside objective assessments.\n\nHowever, relying wholly on AI for ethical decision-making also presents challenges such as;\n\n1. Ethical biases in algorithms/design - Machines learn from historical/current human-generated datasets that often unintentionally involve inherent biases thus creating unfair treatment/discrimination towards certain individuals/groups unless vigilantly corrected early in development/testing stages.\n \n2.Machine explanations v.s qualitative factors- It's difficult for machines' output/decision criteria/rulesets inherently numeric/logic-based metrics/sources  which ain't capable of considering/incorporating morals,sentiments/intentions behind potentially wrong actions(e.g Juxtapose utilitarianism Vs Kantian Rules 'if lying a bad person save"
