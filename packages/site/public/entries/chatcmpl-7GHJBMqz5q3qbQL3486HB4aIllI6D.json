        "content": "Penicillin is a group of antibiotics that are derived from the fungi Penicillium. These drugs work by fighting bacteria and preventing them from multiplying in our bodies, thereby stopping infections caused by these bacteria. This group of antibiotics is used to treat various bacterial infections including respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin infections, and sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis.\n\nPenicillin works primarily by targeting the bacterial cell wall synthesis process. Bacterial cells rely on their strong cell walls to maintain their structure and protect themselves against osmotic pressure changes in their surrounding environment; hence disruption of this function would result in weakening or lysing of the bacterium.\n\nThe main mechanism through which penicillin attacks bacteria is by binding to an enzyme known as penicillin-binding protein (PBP), located on the inner surface of bacterial cell membranes. PBP aids in the construction of peptidoglycan polymers that make up the bacterial cell wall. When penicillin binds with PBP, it interferes with its ability to produce these crucial building blocks resulting in inhibition of cross-linking process necessary for providing strength and rigidity to the new peptidoglycan layer.\n\nAs a consequence, weakened points are created in the cell walls where structural integrity has been compromised due to faulty synthesis. The higher internal osmotic pressure within bacterium then forces water into it causing lysis (cell bursting) leading ultimately resulted death of harmful bacteria while leaving human cells unaffected because they lack this particular target site making them selective antimicrobial agents free from side-effects upon proper administration dosage-wise following medical advice based prescription requirements outlined accordingly case-specific patient health parameters under direct supervision/licensed physician etcetera etcâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰"
