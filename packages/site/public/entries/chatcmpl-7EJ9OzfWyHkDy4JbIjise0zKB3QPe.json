He served as the spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban and became one of several high-ranking leaders who defected from TTP in favor of ISIS. \n\nShahidullah Shahid reportedly died in July 2015 during a drone strike carried out by US forces in Afghanistan. The drone targeted a group suspected to be plotting attacks on NATO-led troops stationed there at that time."
