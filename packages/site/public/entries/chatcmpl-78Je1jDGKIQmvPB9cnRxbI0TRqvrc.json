        "content": "To calculate the gallons of a cylinder, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\nVolume (V) = π * r² * h\n\nwhere:\n- π (pi) is a mathematical constant and approximately equal to 3.14159265\n- r is the radius of the base circle\n- h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nLet's take an example.\nSuppose you have a cylindrical tank with a diameter of 10 ft and height 20 ft. First, you need to find out its radius by dividing its diameter in half: \n\nr = Diameter /2 = 10ft/2=5ft\n\nNow using our formula above we can calculate V:\n\nV = π(5ft)^2 × (20ft)\n\nV ≈ (3.14)(25 sq.ft)(20ft)\nV ≈7850 cubic feet\n\nConvert cubic feet to gallons:\n1 cubic foot equals approximately 7.48 gallons.\n\nGallons ≈7850 cu ft × approx.7.48 gals/cu.ft\nGallons ≈approx58,658 Gals \n\nSo, this cylindrical water tank holds about approximately 58,658 gallons when full."
