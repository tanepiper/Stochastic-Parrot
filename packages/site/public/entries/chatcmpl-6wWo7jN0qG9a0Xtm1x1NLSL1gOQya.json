AI algorithms are designed by humans and can have biases or limitations in understanding the nuances of human language and context. Additionally, AI is trained on existing datasets which may contain misinformation or biased content.\n\nMoreover, as language and communication evolve over time, AI needs to constantly update its models to understand new slang terms or emerging patterns of communication that might affect its ability to correctly classify news articles.\n\nFurthermore, malicious actors often use techniques like deepfakes or propaganda manipulation to deceive users with false information which could potentially outsmart AI systems if they aren't up-to-date with evolving threats.\n\nHowever, researchers are consistently working on improving AI's accuracy in identifying reliable news sources while eliminating these shortcomings. Although not perfect yet, using a combination of tools including AI along with collaborative efforts from humans can help mitigate the spread of disinformation online."
