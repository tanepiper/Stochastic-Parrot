Flowchart: A graphical representation of a process or workflow, showing the steps as boxes and connecting arrows to indicate the flow.\n\n2.

Pie Chart: It represents proportions by dividing a circle into sectors according parts-to-whole differences between categories/variables involvedolving a problem solving plan(strategy), developing learning concepts(math-reasoning)\n\n7 Network Diagram :Used when modeling complex interactions/exchanges between actors/nodes in given context too broad elaborate detail concurrently through cluster arrangements linked together with single/multiple connectors representing correlated dynamics discovered(entailed/facilitated) networks(place-space-time dimensions represented).\n\n8.Use Case Diagrams - these types depict functionalities provided by systems/classes/objects(OOP not limited), highlighting internal functional divisions(employ-use case scenario framework encapsulation principles/module separation/domain-driven control mechanisms/parsing content blocks/object/context-oriented-logic delegation pattern prevalence)} thereby refining/highlighting essential features required(required desirable-flexibility degree"
