Combine dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.\n\n2. Create your wet mixture: In another bowl (or using a liquid measuring cup), combine the milk and eggs.\n\n3. Gradually add wet mixture to dry mix: Slowly pour the milk and egg mixture into the flour blend while continuously whisking until you have a smooth batter with no lumps. The consistency should be somewhat thin—similar to heavy cream.\n\n4. Stir in melted butter: Add your three tablespoons of melted butter to the batter and stir well until fully combined.\n\n5.
