Intellectual Property Rights: As AI programs create content, there could be concerns surrounding the ownership of intellectual property rights for their creations since those generated works can neither solely exist under human-authored nor machine-generated work.\n\n2. Bias and Discrimination: AI models may incorporate unintentional biases from existing data or systems—leading to potentially biased decision-making or discriminatory results in its output.\n\n3. Privacy Violations: An intrusion into personal privacy is possible when algorithms utilize personal information (data) without consent to generate novel content (AI-based content generation using user photos or writings as input).\n\n4. Plagiarism / Copyright Infringement: AI systems might recombine existing ideas and produce derivative works posing challenges concerning copyright infringement if copyrighted material forms part of the source stimuli during any creation process.\n\n5. Authenticity and Originality: The authenticity of an artwork can be compromised as machines reproduce numerous iterations bearing subjective resemblance to one another, causing a devaluation effect on unique artistic endeavors typically credited to humans by reproducing variations instead of truly original pieces.\n\n6. Unethical Uses & Content: There is potential for misuse of these capabilities towards generating harmful, offensive, malicious, or deceitful content which goes against social norms and values\n\n7. Job Losses & Economic Impacts– Human artists' careers may be affected due to competition with AIs capable of producing high-quality work very quickly at lower costs; this raises questions about economic consequences tied up with such shifts within labor markets dominated previously primarily by humans across all creative fields involved relying upon creativity\n\n8. Moral responsibility - Who will be held accountable morally/legally for unintended harms caused by AI's autonomous \"creative decisions"
