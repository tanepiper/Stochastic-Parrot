Obtain expert assistance – If possible, involve an experienced private investigator or cybersecurity professional who can help reveal the spy's identity through advanced techniques.\n\n4.Save digital evidence - Save emails, text messages and screenshots showing instances of stalking/spying attempts\n\n6.
