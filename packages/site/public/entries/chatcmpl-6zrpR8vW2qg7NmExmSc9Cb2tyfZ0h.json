        "content": "An alkaline battery is a type of disposable primary battery which derives its energy from an alkaline electrolyte, typically potassium hydroxide (KOH). These batteries are cylindrical in shape and come in various sizes such as AA, AAA, C, and D.\n\nThe basic components of an alkaline battery include a zinc anode (negative electrode), a manganese dioxide cathode (positive electrode), and the potassium hydroxide electrolyte. When the battery is connected to a device or circuit that draws power, chemical reactions occur at both electrodes. This causes electrons to flow from the negative terminal through the connected device and back into the positive terminal.\n\nAt the negative electrode:\nZn(s) + 2 OH-(aq) → Zn(OH)2(s) + 2 e-\n\nAt the positive electrode:\nMnO2(s) + H2O(l) + e- → MnOOH(s)+OH-(aq)\n\nThese reactions result in electron transfer between the two electrodes via an external circuit, providing electrical energy to devices like remotes-controls or toys. Alkaline batteries generally have longer life workings than other types like zinc-carbon batteries due to their higher energy density and lower internal resistance.\n\nOver time as chemical reactions continue inside a battery; it eventually loses capacity for more charge flow resulting in end-of-life disposal. Considered safe for environment landfill disposals since containing no hazardous materials; while recycling facilities offer specialized treatments ensuring metal reusability within new products thusly minimizing waste impacts overall across industry sectors worldwide today!"
