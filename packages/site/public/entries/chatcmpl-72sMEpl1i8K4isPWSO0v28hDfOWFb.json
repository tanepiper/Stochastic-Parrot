It uses signals transmitted by GPS satellites, allowing our smartphones or other devices to calculate their exact position on the planet.\n\nThe global positioning system was developed in 1973 by the United States Department of Defense and became fully operational in 1995. Initially, it was created for military purposes but later opened up for civilian use after a presidential order issued in 1983. Nowadays, GPS plays an essential role in various industries such as transportation, agriculture, emergency services and smartphone technology.\n\nAccuracy may vary depending on several factors including atmospheric conditions and signal blockage due to buildings or trees. However, advanced technologies like Assisted-GPS have been developed to overcome these issues while further enhancing accuracy levels down to around three meters or less under optimal circumstances.\n\nTo use GPS effectively:\n\n1. Ensure that you have a device with built-in GPS capability: Most modern smartphones are equipped with this feature.\n2. Enable Location Services/GPS on your device: Look through your device settings menu for location-related options; often found under \"Privacy\" or \"Security.\"\n3. Check if your phone has the necessary software applications installed: Downloading apps specifically designed for navigating should help maximize efficiency—Google Maps being an excellent example—especially when traveling unknown territory.\n4. Optimal reception depends upon clear line-of-sight between your device & sky; therefore minimizing obstructions helps improve accuracy: Locate yourself outside high-rise buildings/tall structures adding proper elevation aids effectivenessーstanding atop hills/large open fields likewise worth considering.\n5.Set up waypoints/popular destinations beforehand within desired app accordingly streamlines process preclude possibility confusion mid-navigation−"
