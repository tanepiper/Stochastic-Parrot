Different forms of government provide various ways to address these diverse aspects.\n\n1. Suitability: A specific form of government may be more appropriate or suitable for one country due to factors such as size, population density, level of development, social structure and historical experiences. For instance, what works in a large federal republic might not necessarily work in a small city-state.\n\n2. Responsiveness: Different societies have different expectations from their governments based on their histories and cultures. Various forms of government can cater to the distinct demands made by citizens depending on the political environment they are used to.\n\n3. Representation: The diversity found within countries often necessitates having multiple parties or factions represented within national governance structures (even if just under a single system). Different types of governments allow for better representation according to local issues as well as potentially encouraging popular participation in politics.\n\n4. Adaptation: As societies evolve over time they may prefer changes – sometimes drastic ones – in governmental systems so that it reflects shifts not only occurring domestically but also internationally (such when nations seek closer integration with global organizations since globalization is now increasingly prevalent). Having multiple potential avenues open regarding governance structures increases countries' options should circumstances require them considering new governing models altogether down the line.\n\n5.Secretariat division: Reducing concentrated power between too few individuals/groups decreases chances corruption becoming rampant given responsibilities rested fewer hands than otherwise were there divided authority across more sectors among democratically elected representatives belonging different parties charged enacting policies benefiting broadest swathes populations possible.]\n\n6.Stability through Checks and Balances : Multiple branches/parts co-existing alongside solitary executive branch which sole responsibility handling sweeping agendas"
