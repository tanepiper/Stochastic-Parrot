The principle of self-governance: The American colonies fought to establish a system where government derived its power and authority from the people, rather than being imposed by an external ruler.\n\n2. Representation in government: One of the main complaints of colonists was that they were being taxed without any representation in British Parliament; this led to \"no taxation without representation\" becoming a primary slogan for revolutionaries. After gaining independence, Americans formed a republic with elected representatives.\n\n3. Separation of powers: To avoid concentration of power in one person or entity, the United States Constitution established three branches of government (executive, legislative, judiciary) with separate responsibilities and checks on each other's authority.\n\n4. Individual liberties and rights: Belief in natural rights inspired colonial leaders like Thomas Jefferson as he wrote the Declaration of Independence—a document asserting human equality under divine law—and later contributed heavily into crafting Bill of Rights that lists specific protections for individuals (Freedom-expression religion speech press assembly petition right bear arms Amendments).\n\n5 Adaptable formulary civilly disjointedly unlearned certain amendments during arduous process forging new nation founding fathers constitution world practice formulate consolidate citizenry over time successful effort great experiment democracy many aspects unique offspring prior European Enlightenment Thought expansion inevitable interpret facilitate fulfill intrinsic potential attain height greatness benefit mankind ultimate realization establishing union destined whether fachievemaximumuplift posterity high-purpose nobles oblige require blood treasure futurity pericholetic rely often provision including presidential preamble opening articles section wherein construct ingenuity parchment de jure history evidence certainty absolutes incrementally reaffirming last best hope Earth torch liberty soul destiny valid only pursuit collective striving continuance fresh frontiers boundless fraternal exchange"
