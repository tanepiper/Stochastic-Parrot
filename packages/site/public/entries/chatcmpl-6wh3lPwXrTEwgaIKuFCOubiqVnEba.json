However, it is known that elephants are highly social animals and can form bonds relatively quickly.\n\nGenerally, female elephants live in close-knit family groups called herds. When a new member is introduced to the group, they may be initially cautious but can start showing friendly behavior within hours or days after meeting. This might involve touching each other with their trunks or engaging in play behavior.\n\nMale elephants typically lead more solitary lives and associate primarily during breeding season. They do occasionally form friendships with other males through alliances called \"bachelor herds.\" These bonds may take longer to develop as they don't spend as much time together compared to females residing within the same herd.\n\nIn summary, it would be safe to assume that elephant friendships develop over several encounters spanning days or weeks rather than occurring instantly at first sight."
