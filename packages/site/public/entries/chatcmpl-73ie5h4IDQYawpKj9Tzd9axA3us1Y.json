Business Plan: Start by creating a detailed business plan, which serves as the road map for your operations. This should include information about your target market, competitive landscape, marketing strategy, financial projections and future growth plans.\n\n2. Legal Structure: Decide on the most suitable legal structure for your small business (e.g., sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC) and register accordingly with local authorities to ensure compliance with regulations.\n\n3. Licenses & Permits: Obtain necessary licenses and permits required by federal, state or local governments to legally operate in specific industries or locations.\n\n4. Insurance Coverage: Secure adequate insurance coverage to protect your assets from potential risks such as liability claims or employee injuries/disputes.\n\n5. Location Setup: Find an appropriate location that meets the needs of your operations while keeping costs low (e.g., commercial lease agreement if needed).\n\n6. Technology Infrastructure Setup: Invest in technology infrastructure so employees can communicate effectively across multiple devices/platforms; this could include personal computers or laptops with internet access capability through Wi-Fi routers/modems at home office settings until more permanent solutions can be built out later based on growth targets identified within initially developed comprehensive strategy plans beforehand.\n\n7 Workforce Recruitment & Training Process"
