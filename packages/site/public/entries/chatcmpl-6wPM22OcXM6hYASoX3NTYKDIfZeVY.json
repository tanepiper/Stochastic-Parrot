Here are guidelines to consider:\n\n1. Reflect your teaching philosophy: Your classroom should represent your approach towards teaching and learning - be it more structured or flexible.\n\n2. Keep it age-appropriate: Make sure the decoration is suitable for the students' age group in terms of content, themes, and graphics.\n\n3. Showcase student work: Displaying their projects and achievements is an excellent way to motivate them further and instill pride in their accomplishments.\n\n4. Foster collaboration: Decorating should create a sense of community within the classroom (e.g., group seating arrangements, shared art supplies).\n\n5.Replace clutter with orderliness: A well-organized space improves focus prevents accidents due to unmanaged materials lying around haphazardly.\n\n6.Periodically change displays \n7.Practical wall areas\n8.Create sections for different activities\n9.Consider visual presentation rules.\n10.Promote inclusivity"
