They can perform various functions independently by analyzing and processing data as well as adapting their methods based on learned information. This ability differs from traditional computational programming, which relies solely on humans for input and decision making.\n\nAI technology encompasses multiple fields of study such as machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision. It has the potential to improve our lives in many areas such as healthcare diagnostics, smart cities infrastructure management, automated transportation systems development among others.\n\nIn short: Yes! Artificial intelligence refers to computers or machines capable of learning autonomously through experience and adapting their behavior accordingly without human intervention."
