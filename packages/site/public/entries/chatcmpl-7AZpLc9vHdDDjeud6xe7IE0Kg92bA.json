It's a shared virtual space that can include many different interconnected digital spaces, virtual worlds, augmented reality experiences, and more.\n\nOverall, the idea of the Metaverse is to create an online space where people can interact with one another in real-time through avatars or other digital representations. It will not only allow users to socialize but also work, do business transactions and gaming simultaneously within that same environment.\n\nIt's expected that access to the Metaverse could eventually be available on several platforms such as smartphones, laptops/desktops utilizing VR/AR glasses/headsets or possibly even futuristic technology like brain-computer interfaces.\n\nSome major players in tech are already working on building their own versions of the metaverse (such as Facebook), while others have existing platforms that may form part of it (like Microsoftâ€™s Minecraft). A fully realized metaverse would involve interconnectivity between these individual efforts creating a seamless experience for end-users."
