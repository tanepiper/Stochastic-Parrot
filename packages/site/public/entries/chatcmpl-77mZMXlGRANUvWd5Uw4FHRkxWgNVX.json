This perception might make society less appreciative of the uniqueness and dignity inherent in every human life.\n\n2. Loss of Individuality: Cloning would create identical genetic copies which could significantly reduce or alter diversity within a species - this can lead to concerns about an individual's right to their own unique identity.\n\n3. Playing God: Creating cloned individuals might be perceived as scientists \"playing God,\" which may spark debates around whether humans should have the power to control such aspects of nature and biology.\n\n4. Consent: Because clones cannot provide consent for their creation or existence before they exist, some argue that producing a clone disregards one's rights over self-determination – especially if conceived for reasons beyond their best interests (e.g., reproduction purposes).\n\n5. Exploitation: There is potential for clones to be used insincerely by those who seek financial gain through organ harvesting from cloned bodies without permission or medical necessity - this may violate human rights laws surrounding medical exploitation.\n\n6.
