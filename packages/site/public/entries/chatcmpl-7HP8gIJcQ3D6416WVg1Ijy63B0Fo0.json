It can be found in organisms like plants, animals, fungi, and protists. It is characterized by its larger size compared to prokaryotic cells and the presence of multiple linear chromosomes within its nucleus.\n\nKey differences between plant cells and animal cells include:\n\n1. Cell wall structure: Plant cells have a rigid cell wall made up of cellulose that provides support to the plant's shape and protects it from mechanical damage. Animal cells do not have a cellulose-based cell wall but instead rely on their cytoskeleton for internal support; they are held together by extracellular matrix proteins on their outer surface.\n\n2. Centrioles: Animal cells possess centrioles that play important roles in cellular replication during mitosis or meiosis (cell division). These structures function as microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) during these processes. On the other hand, while some lower plant species may still have centriole-like structures called \"plastids,\" most higher plants lack this organelle altogether.\n\n3. Plastids: A key defining characteristic of plant cells is their plastids—especially chloroplasts—that contain pigments necessary for photosynthesis. This process converts sunlight into energy through an organism's metabolic activities in autotrophic (self-nourishing) life forms like plants themselves or algae from which they evolved millions of years ago.\n\n4. Vacuole size: While both types have vacuoles for storing materials internally—including water retention—the large central vacuole typically occupies around 30% more volume within many mature"
