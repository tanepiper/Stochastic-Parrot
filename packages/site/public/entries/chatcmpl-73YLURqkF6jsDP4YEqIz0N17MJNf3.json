Some merely follow preprogrammed rules or rely on basic computing algorithms rather than employing artificial intelligence.\n\n3. Job losses due solely to AI: Another misconception surrounding artificial intelligence states it will lead to massive job loss across various sectors. However, the truth is more complex - while some jobs may become obsolete; others will evolve under the influence of technology.\n\n4-10th.text"
