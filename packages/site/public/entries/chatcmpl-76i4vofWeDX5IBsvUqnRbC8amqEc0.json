Vietnam - After shifting from a centrally planned economy to a socialist-oriented market economy in the 1980s, Vietnam has made significant progress in poverty reduction and human development.\n2. China - Although technically under Communist rule, China now practices some aspects of socialism along with state capitalism. Under this system, the country has experienced rapid economic growth over the past few decades.\n\n3. Cuba - Despite ongoing economic difficulties due to U.S. sanctions and other factors, Cuba has remained committed to its version of socialism while also providing free healthcare and education for all citizens.\n\nHowever, it's essential to keep in mind that each example above encompasses different forms and implementations of \"socialism.\" Assessing their success remains complicated as supporters often highlight positive outcomes like reduced inequality or better access to public services while detractors emphasize problems like inefficiencies or restrictions on personal freedom.\n\nWhile no pure form of socialism exists today at a national level (an earlier example would be Yugoslavia), plenty of Nordic-model nations successfully implement hybrid systems combining elements of capitalism with social democratic policies such as universal healthcare and strong social safety nets; these nations include Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden & Iceland"
