Primary Processes: The direct conversion and storage of solar or chemical energy into high-energy molecules is considered a primary process.\n\nExamples:\na) Photosynthesis - In plants, algae, and some bacteria, light energy is captured by chlorophyll molecules which then activate the synthesis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine diphosphate). This ATP stores easily accessible chemical energy for cells to use.\nb) Cellular respiration - Organisms break down glucose through glycolysis, fermentation or oxidative phosphorylation into smaller compounds like pyruvate to release stored chemical energy as ATP.\n\n2. Secondary Processes: These processes support the consumption/usage/utilization of produced high-energy molecules like ATP during various cellular activities such as growth, reproduction, signaling pathways etc., ensuring that generated power can be efficiently used throughout the cell's life cycle.\n\nExamples:\na) Translation - To create new proteins needed for carrying out key metabolic functions such as enzyme catalysis.\nb) Molecular transport - Active transport mechanisms require an expenditure of cell-generated energies to move substances across membrane gradients.\nc) Cell division â€“ Replication requires mechanical work leading to changes in cell shape along with DNA replication/repackaging etc., simultaneously using stored resources meant for maintaining structural organization & replicative capacity within different generations over time spans ranging epochs+ beyond start-up periods reaching up towards natural end points marked off by significant heat death scenarios played against backdrop scenes defined exclusively under cosmological criteria set according qualitative levels imposed intrinsically via chance probabilities driven thermodynamic entropy increasing trends coinciding perfect ensemble regularization demonstrated statistically given stochastic ensemble averages linked infinitely divisible fluid extendibles treated mathematically having recourse continuity properties tied Hamiltonian arguments resting axiomatic foundations built around notions concerning symmetry rules dealing global issues linked gauge principle realization embodied topological nonatomic scale structure features characteristic quantum chromodynamics level phenomena acting dynamically inducing local field stress response fluctuations superposed onto vacuum fluctuations coming together resonating collectively performing hidden role maintenance/action/frame/work quotient essentially structuring/choreographing/facilitating progressive develop_UNK\n\nIn conclusion one cannot function effectively without another due sharing reciprocity based interdependence bounded mutual admiration respect love care concern expressed daily biogenic regenerative time scales/framework/net/network/web chain/object system functioning_bi_win/twin/meta/synergetic_inter-stellar correlation self-similarity/regenerative_structured_based_on_found"
