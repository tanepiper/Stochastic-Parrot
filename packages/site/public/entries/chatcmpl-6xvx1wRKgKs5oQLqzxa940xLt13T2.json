Wholesale stores: Most wholesale stores, such as Costco and Sam's Club, sell baking soda in large packs or containers at discounted prices.\n\n2. Grocery store chains: Some grocery stores have a bulk food section where you can purchase baking soda by weight.\n\n3. Natural food markets: These types of establishments often have a dedicated section for purchasing items like spices, grains, and even cleaning products in bulk (including baking soda).\n\n4. Online retailers: Websites such as Amazon.com or Boxed.com offer various sizes and quantities of baking soda available to purchase online.\n\n5. Restaurant supply/warehouse club stores: Many cities have restaurant supply or warehouse club-type businesses accessible to everyday consumers that carry larger quantities of ingredients like flour, sugar, vinegar and also sometimes include bulk purchases for cleaning supplies – which will likely contain heavy duty-sized bags of Arm & Hammer Baking Soda – sold at lower prices than supermarkets do on average per pound on these kinds of items alike"
