Lean meats: Primarily from grass-fed animals or wild game.\n2. Fish: Including fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines for their high omega-3 fatty acid content.\n3. Vegetables: A wide range of non-starchy vegetables like leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, peppers, etc.\n4. Fruits: Fresh fruits with a focus on low glycemic fruits such as berries and apples.\n5. Nuts and seeds: In moderation due to their relatively high calorie density (but excluding peanuts since they are legumes).\n6. Healthy fats/oils: Obtained from sources like avocados, nuts/seeds/their butters (almond butter/tahini), olive oil/coconut oil/fatty fish.\n\nFoods to avoid in the paleo diet are those that are products of modern agriculture and processing:\n\n1. Grains/cereals - wheat/barley/rice/oats/quinoa/etc., including gluten-free grains\n2. Legumes - beans/lentils/chickpeas/peanuts\n3. Dairy (although some versions allow grass-fed butter/ghee)\n4.
