        "content": "Yes, Ethernet cables can go bad over time. The copper wires inside the cable may degrade, and connectors or plugs may become damaged or corroded, leading to poor connection quality or complete connection loss.\n\nCommon causes for Ethernet cable failure include:\n\n1. Physical damage: Bending or crushing the cable repeatedly could cause physical damage to internal wiring.\n2. Corrosion: Exposure to moisture and contaminants in the environment might lead to corrosion on RJ45 connectors.\n3. Manufacturing defects: Some cables have inherent flaws introduced during production that cause them to fail prematurely.\n4. Electromagnetic interference (EMI): Electrical devices emitting strong radio frequency noise nearby can interfere with signal transmission within unshielded Ethernet cables.\n5. Cable age: Older cables are more susceptible to wear and tear; they can lose their ability for proper signal transmission causing operation degradation.\n\nIf an Ethernet cable fails or delivers suboptimal performance, it is best to replace it with a new one of appropriate category/specification suited for your networking needs (such as Cat 6 or Cat 7)."
