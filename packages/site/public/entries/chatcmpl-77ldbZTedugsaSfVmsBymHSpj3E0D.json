If there is anything more that I can do or prepare for you, just let me know. Enjoy!\n\nCustomer: Thanks again. Everything looks great so far, but would it be possible to get a side of mushrooms with this?\n\nChef: Absolutely! Do you prefer sauteed or grilled mushrooms?\n\nCustomer: Grilled sounds delicious!\n\nChef: Excellent choice! I'll have our kitchen provide those as soon as possible for you.\n\nCustomer: Great, thank you so much.\n\n(post-meal)\n\nWaiter/Server (not Chef): How was everything today?
