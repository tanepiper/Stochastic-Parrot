        "content": "There are a few potential reasons for why the \"19\" is included in COVID-19:\n\n1. Official naming convention: The World Health Organization (WHO) has established particular guidelines for how they name new diseases, including avoiding references to specific countries, animals, or individuals in order to minimize stigma and any social or economic impacts. In this context, \"CO\" stands for corona, \"VI\" refers to virus, while the letter \"D\" signifies disease.\n\n2. Year of identification: The number 19 represents the year that novel coronavirus was first identified – in this case during December 2019 (although its spread globally primarily occurred throughout 2020). As such days new strain of coronavirus emerged at the end of 2019; hence it's named as COVID-19.\n\n3. Differentiation from other coronaviruses: Since there are several types of coronaviruses already known to scientists (including SARS which caused a global outbreak back in 2003), assigning numbers helps differentiate between various strains when discussing these viruses within academic research papers and media reports around related topics like public health issues associated with infectious diseases etcetera!\n\nIn short – by calling it COVID-19 “demonstrates more accurate scientific language” according rules set forth strategy page shared World Health Organisation website explaining their approach naming processes dealing outbreaks & emergency situations worldwide factfile report studying habits medical communications further explained"
