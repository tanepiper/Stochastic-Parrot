User registration and login: Allow users to create an account with an email address or social media account. This will help personalize their experience within the app.\n\n2. Restaurant search: A robust search feature that allows users to find nearby restaurants based on their current location, price range, cuisine type, dietary preferences, and more.\n\n3. Menus and dish details: Display menus of all listed restaurants along with information about individual dishes such as descriptions, ingredients/allergens (if any), pricing, pictures etc.\n\n4.Input from other customers(digits): Enable users to rate food items out of 10 points so they can better determine which dishes are worth trying at various restaurants\n\n5.Customer reviews and ratings: An integrated review system where diners can write about their experiences post-visit at a restaurant while also reading others' reviews before making reservation decisions\n\n6.Food ordering for pickup/delivery/curbside service"
