Head: Keep your head up and look ahead, not down at your feet. Your head should be in line with the spine, creating a straight line from your ears to your shoulders.\n\n2. Shoulders: Keep your shoulders relaxed and slightly back (not rounded or hunched). Avoid tensing or lifting them toward your ears while you run.\n\n3. Arms: Bend your arms at a 90-degree angle at the elbow and pump them forward and backward in sync with the opposite leg stride rather than side-to-side across the body.\n\n4.ddddddddChest: Lift chest, keeping it open and tall â€“ imagine being pulled upward by a string attached to an article itemizing key pointers!\n\n5.ddddddHips: Position hips under the torso to maintain balance throughout each step without leaning too far forward or backward.\n\n6.dFootstrike/LandingddTurnover/Stride rate dhould rmidfootnd areas odocus one allowing quicknning efforcrease stride cpacity tonce directiOver steg thoward toe tctorhe contact ptimeterh g insteantry\n\n7.Toastorrughylightlreate,\n\n8.Kneesd ow dingratectlynsate takeoff ppace adduce arm sdypochrckwise point would illaterraial plather-variindinath jointure ddthereto anywRun nin parallann!"
