Individual attention: In a smaller class, teachers can attend to each student's individual needs more effectively, offering personalized support and guidance.\n\n2.

Fewer distractions: A smaller group of students creates a quieter environment that helps learners focus on their work without being interrupted or distracted by unnecessary noise.\n\n4. Improved relationships between teacher and students: In small classrooms, it is easier for educators to form strong relationships with their pupils, creating an atmosphere where mentorship and trust are possible.\n\n5.
