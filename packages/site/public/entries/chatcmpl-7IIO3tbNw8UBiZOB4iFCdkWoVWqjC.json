Cost: Many people resort to downloading music illegally because they cannot afford to purchase the content legitimately, particularly if they want a large collection. Digital media can be costly, and some individuals may not have the disposable income to spend on extensive libraries.\n\n2. Availability: In some cases, certain songs or albums might not be available through legal means in one's country or region due to copyright restrictions or exclusivity deals with specific streaming platforms. As a result, an individual may choose to download the content illegally so they can access it.\n\n3. Convenience: Downloading music via file-sharing websites is often considered faster and more convenient than going through official channels like iTunes and similar services since there is no need for payment methods or user accounts.\n\n4. Lack of awareness about legality: Some individuals may not understand that their actions are illegal when they engage in unauthorized downloading activity because they do not understand digital copyright laws.\n\n5.Navigate around DRM issues:\nStrict digital rights management (DRM) policies by legitimate sources sometimes make it harder for users to consume purchased content across different devices leading them towards piracy being much easier\n\n6.Quality preference : \nIn certain cases , paid platforms might compromise quality inorder save server storage.In this case people searching for high defination files go off route"
