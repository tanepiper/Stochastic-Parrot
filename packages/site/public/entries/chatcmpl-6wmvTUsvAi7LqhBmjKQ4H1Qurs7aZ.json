Research and preparation: Before entering a negotiation, gather as much information as possible about the issue at hand and the parties involved. Understand their interests, priorities, strengths, weaknesses, and potential strategies.\n\n2. Establish clear goals: Identify your objectives for the negotiation and determine what you are willing to concede or compromise on to achieve these goals.\n\n3. Develop rapport: Build trust and establish good relationships with your counterparts by being approachable, respectful, attentive to their concerns, asking questions to clarify your understanding of their position.\n\n4. Active listening: Practice active listening during negotiations by paying attention not only to the content but also non-verbal cues such as body language and tone of voice that may reveal more about a person's true intentions than words alone.\n\n5. Emotional intelligence: Manage your own emotions while recognizing those of others - this will help you stay calm under pressure when negotiating tough deals or handling difficult people.\n\n6. Be flexible yet firm in your approach: Know when to be assertive without coming across as aggressive or confrontational; show willingness for compromise while maintaining focus on achieving desired outcomes even if it means making concessions through trade-offs between competing interests/issues/goals/values held dear by different stakeholders/parties engaged within context given particular situation/circumstances they find themselves under\n\n7.
