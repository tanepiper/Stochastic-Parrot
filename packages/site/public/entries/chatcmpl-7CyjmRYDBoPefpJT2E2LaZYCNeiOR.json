They include:\n\n1.Water supply: Rivers provide fresh water that can be used for drinking, irrigation, and other uses in our daily lives.\n\n2.Habitat for biodiversity: Rivers provide a wide variety of habitats for plants, animals, and microorganisms. The biodiversity supported in riparian zones helps maintain the ecosystem balance needed to support life on Earth.\n\n3.Flood control: Water storage capacity created by river systems help absorb excess rainfall during storms or periods of heavy precipitation. This function reduces the risk of flooding in nearby areas.\n\n4.Sediment transport and deposition: Rivers collect and transport sediment from higher elevations to lower ones. As they flow downstream, sediment is deposited along banks and floodplains providing rich nutrients that support plant growth around the river system.\n\n5.Nutrient cycling: Through their role in transporting nutrients (such as nitrogen), rivers contribute to nutrient cycling essential for maintaining soil fertility which sustains agriculture production.\n\n6.Recreational activities: River environments offer outdoor enthusiasts a range of leisure opportunities like fishing, boating or kayaking contributing both directly/indirectly towards economy through tourism expenditure associated with them .\n\n7.Carbon sequestrationsthrough processes such as photosynthesis by vegetation growing along riverbanks also help regulate global climate change related issues arising due excessive atmospheric carbon accumulation caused human activities especially fossil fuel burning hence it becomes important conserve protect pristine ecosystems containing healthy functioning green infrastructures who deliver immense environmental societal benefits way beyond simplistic calculation based traditional market metrics often fail encompass these values fully into account when designing public policies regarding land-use decisions particularly so globally urbanization rates continuing increase exponentially leaving behind shrinking natural spaces within which local species thrive interact symbiotically discharging 'ecosystem services"
