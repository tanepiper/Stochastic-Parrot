Listen patiently: Give the hostile person space to express their thoughts and feelings. Let them know that you are listening attentively without interrupting or talking over them.\n\n3. Use assertive communication: Speak clearly, concisely, and calmly while expressing your perspective on the situation. Make sure not to be passive or aggressive in your tone of voice.\n\n4. Be empathetic: Try understanding things from the other person's point of view by putting yourself in their shoes for a moment.\n\n5. Avoid escalating the conflict: Stay away from reacting defensively or negatively towards any criticisms thrown at you; this can exacerbate tension between both parties involved.\n\n6 Set boundaries firmly but fairly - Inform those who may be acting aggressively about what type of behavior is acceptable around you without being confrontational yourself\n\n7 Offer potential solutions- Work together on problem-solving strategies based on common goals/preferences shared by all individuals within these interactions"
