Extensive loss of life: A large-scale nuclear war could result in the deaths of tens or even hundreds of millions of people, depending on the number and size of the bombs involved.\n\n2. Environmental devastation: Nuclear explosions would cause widespread destruction to both natural and human-made environments. This includes forests, bodies of water, and entire cities being leveled.\n\n3. Fallout & radiation poisoning: Radioactive fallout from nuclear blasts could contaminate vast areas with hazardous particles that can lead to long-term health problems for those exposed.\n\n4. Climate change & other atmospheric effects: A \"nuclear winter\" (cooling effect caused by soot kicked up when multiple cities burn in a short period) may happen as smoke block sunlight causing global surface temperatures to drop significantly for several years.This may have significant impact on agricultural production leading food scarcity\n\n5.Public health crises & diseases : Weakened medical infrastructure due to bombardments combined with mass displacement make it difficult to treat survivors causing increased spread in infections/diseases \n\n6.Economic collapse - With major industry centres destroyed countries wouldn't be able  which will stagnate economies around the world especially countries reliant on badly affected ones .\n\n7.Psychological trauma- The lasting stress induced from witnessing such an event would have lifelong psychological impacts , something similar like 'shell shock' happening post WWII . \n\n8.Breakdown societal order - An unstable atmosphere caused  may lead certain regions/groups breaking off into more chaos-causing factions due urgent need survival necessities.\n \n9.International instability since lots associated international systems run via superpowers who'd face worst impact thus creating power vacuum globally\n"
