The evolution of data storage devices goes through different stages that share various important milestones.\n\n1. Paper: Before electronic means, people relied on written records on paper for thousands of years.\n\n2. Punch cards: In the late 1800s, Herman Hollerith invented punch cards which were able to store simple data by using holes punched in cardstock paper as binary representations.\n\n3. Magnetic tape: Invented in the early 1920s, magnetic tapes had a relatively high storage capacity compared to previous methods and became widely used for computer data backup and archiving purposes.\n\n4. Hard disk drives (HDD): IBM introduced the first commercial hard drive, or HDD, in 1956 called RAMAC. These devices used magnetic disks coated with iron oxide materials that could be read by a read/write head while spinning at high speeds.\n\n5. Floppy disks: these “floppies” were created as a portable option for moving small amounts of digital information from one location to another easily throughout the ’70s and ’80s when personal computers gained popularity among households.\n\n6. Compact Disc (CD): Sony developed CD-ROM in the mid-1980s utilizing optical principles instead of relying on electromagnetic ones like previous examples such as HDD or Magnetic Tape recorder/player machines previously referred above this text paragraph number three (#3).\n\n7. Digital Versatile Disc (DVD): DVDs came into existence during ’90 when it became essential because they offered higher capacity installations than older mediums allowed – crucial around those times due wide available existing software applications expanding rapidly sizes wise-aware being managed effortlessly without any limitations beside restraints regarding physical space needed thus affecting maintenance efficiency course critical matters indeed depending situation properly"
