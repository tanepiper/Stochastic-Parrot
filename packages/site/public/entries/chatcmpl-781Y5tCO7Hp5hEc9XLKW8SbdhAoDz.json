Since the two groups fall on opposite sides of zero on the number line, it is clear that no positive number can also be a negative number. This conclusion relies on the fundamental properties of real numbers and their respective positions on the number line.\n\nTherefore, we can prove that no positive numbers are negative through basic properties of real numbers, definitions of positivity and negativity, and visualization using the number line concept."
