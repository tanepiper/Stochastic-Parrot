Known for its extreme temperatures and arid landscape, it gained the name \"Death Valley\" from settlers who faced challenging conditions during their westward journey in the mid-1800s.\n\nThe valley stretches over 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) between the Amargosa Range to the east and Panamint Range to the west – both mountain ranges are part of a fault system that forms Death Valley.\n\nBut how can people work or live there? Here are some reasons:\n\n1. Adaptation: Humans have an incredible capacity to adapt to various circumstances as long as they take proper precautions. In Death Valley, adapting means finding ways to stay cool in sweltering heat and conserving water resources.\n\n2. Employment opportunities: Despite its inhospitable climate, people work in Death Valley National Park as park rangers, maintenance staff, scientists studying desert ecology or geology, tour guides at points of interest like Scotty's Castle (currently closed for repair), hotel/resort personnel catering tourists visiting Furnace Creek Visitors Center & The Oasis at Furnace Creek Resort.\n\n3. Love for Nature & Outdoor Lifestyle: Death Valley offers many outdoor recreational activities such as camping beneath starry skies without light pollution interfering with stargazing; exploring unique natural wonders like Devil’s Golf Course (salt pan), Artists Palette Drive(wildly colored volcanic rocks); backcountry hikes through slot canyons or climbs up Telescope Peak attracting visitors worldwide gaining knowledge about desert ecosystems firsthand while managing local expectations with environmental concerns too providing ecosystem balance ensures healthy animal populations\n\n4.
