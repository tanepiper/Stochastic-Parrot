Lack of understanding: If you do not understand the material being taught in class, completing homework assignments may be challenging and frustrating. In this case, seeking additional help from your teacher or tutor can help improve your understanding of the subject matter.\n\n2. Poor time management: If you struggle to manage your time effectively, it is possible that homework may actually take longer than intended and add more stress to your already busy schedule.\n\n3. Low-quality assignments: Some homework assignments might not align with what was taught in class or lack clear instructions, making them difficult to complete and potentially ineffective as learning tools.\n\n4. Insufficient feedback: Without adequate feedback from teachers on how well you completed the assignment or where improvements could be made, it can become challenging to know whether you are effectively mastering the material.\n\n5. Learning style differences: Everyone learns differently – some people learn best through hands-on experiences while others prefer visual explanations or reading about a subject matter. Homework that emphasizes only one specific learning style may not cater to all students' needs.\n\n6.Platform limitations: Online platforms have their unique limitations – technical difficulties during submission period would impede progress\n\nUltimately, determining whether or not homework is beneficial largely depends on considering these various factors and finding ways to make it more effective at improving students’ overall learning experience.In order for due diligence tasks like homeworks benefit maximally , they should be integrated better within regular teaching framework"
