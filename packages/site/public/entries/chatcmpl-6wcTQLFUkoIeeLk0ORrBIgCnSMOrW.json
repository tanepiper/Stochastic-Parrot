Many songwriters and poets are already using AI tools to assist them in creating lyrics and poetry that involve rhyme schemes.\n\nKeep in mind that the quality of generated content may vary depending on the sophistication of the underlying language model used. Some advanced models like OpenAI's GPT-3 have been shown to be quite proficient at completing human-like texts based on an initial input, which includes creating coherent verses and lyrics with appropriate rhyme scheme, meter, and context."
