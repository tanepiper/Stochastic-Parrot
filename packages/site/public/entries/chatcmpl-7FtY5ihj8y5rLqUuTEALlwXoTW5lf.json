Listening actively: Make sure both parties feel heard and understood.\n\n2. Identify the real issue or root cause: Sometimes, conflicts arise from misunderstandings, miscommunication or different perspectives.\n\n3. Speak respectfully and calmly: Avoid raising your voice or using offensive language during discussions as it may escalate tensions.\n\n4. Discuss what each party wants and needs to address the problem together. Be open to compromise so that everyone feels they have gained something towards resolving their concerns.\n\n5. Allow time for reflection: Sometimes disagreements cannot be resolved immediately, but after some time apart to reflect on viewpoints can help facilitate resolution later when emotions are more controlled.\n\n6.Maintain open communication throughout - this will help reduce future misinterpretations leading to conflicts in relationships & allow growth understanding between individuals involved in disagreement"
