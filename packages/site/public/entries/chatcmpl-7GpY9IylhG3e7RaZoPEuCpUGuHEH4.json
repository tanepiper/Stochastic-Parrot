Adjust power settings: Use the Power Saver plan in your Windows or macOS laptop, which automatically adjusts display brightness and other hardware components to save energy.\n\n2. Lower screen brightness: The backlight behind a laptop's display consumes considerable battery power. Reduce screen brightness as much as comfortable when working on the device.\n\n3. Unplug peripherals when not in use: USB devices draw power from your laptop even if they aren't being actively used. Disconnect external hard drives, mice, and other peripherals when you don't need them.\n\n4. Close unnecessary applications: Running multiple applications simultaneously puts extra load on the processor, consuming more battery life; close any unneeded apps running in the background.\n\n5. Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth if not needed: If you're not using these two features, disable them to achieve longer run-time between recharges.\n\n6. Activate Airplane Mode during offline work sessions â€“ This disables all wireless communications (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) saving significant amounts of power for increased battery life.\n\n7.Use hibernation mode instead of sleep mode - Hibernation saves an image of your current settings onto disk space and completely powers down while conserving energy better than normal Sleep mode does\n\n8.Regularly update software -Manufacturers often release updates that streamline code making it consume less resources helping improve overall performance.Use windows default updater or Mac app store to stay up-to-date with OS maintenance patches \n\n9.Maintain optimum temperature:Batteries discharge poorly at overly cold/hot temperatures.Store  laptops away from direct sunlight & vents and around room temperature\n\n10.Perform regular virus scans-Keeping a healthy system free from hidden viruses ensures efficient processing ability without over-usage \n\n"
