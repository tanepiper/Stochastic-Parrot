Some of the potential impacts can include:\n\n1. Land degradation: When people move into new areas, they often clear land to build homes or start agricultural activities. This process can lead to deforestation and loss of natural habitats for plants and animals.\n\n2. Increased demand for natural resources: The growing population in a migrated area puts pressure on local resources like water, forests, and minerals.\n\n3. Pollution: Migration may increase the pollution levels in an area due to more vehicles running on roads emitting harmful gases that contribute significantly to air pollution.\n\n4. Waste generation & disposal problems: With an increased population size comes more waste generation which might lead to improper disposal practices causing soil degradation and water contamination if not handled effectively.\n\n5. Strain Infrastructure Services : Migration directly affects public services which were planned keeping certain people numbers in consideration including transportation networks sanitary system water systems sewage supplies but these surges eventually load pressure onto existing available assets result deterioration working conditions quality serving residentsâ€™ needs accordingly respond positively now unable adapt accommodate newcomers anymore provide essential need desired efficient manner previously be proposed targeted expansion upgrading currently present physical establishment regions marked monitoring responsible department agency matter supervision control developing authorities.\n \n6 .
