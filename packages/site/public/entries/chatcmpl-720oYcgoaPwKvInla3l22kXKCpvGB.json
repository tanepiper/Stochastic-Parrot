First, gather all the necessary tools and materials for cleaning that you'll need such as a bike stand or rack, soft brushes, rags or microfiber cloths, mild dish soap, water in a bucket or hose.\n\n2. Make sure your eBike is off and remove the battery before you start cleaning it. Store the battery in a safe spot away from water sources.\n\n3. Place your eBike on a bike stand if possible; this allows easy access to all parts of the bike without having to lift or flip it over.\n\n4. Using either a pre-moistened rag with soapy water (or gentle spray from a hose), begin wiping down your frame gently removing dirt and debris. Be cautious not to let excessive amounts of water mix with electrical components like the motor or display panel.\n\n5. Use different sizes of brushes for areas such as brake calipers, chainrings and hard-to-reach corners around bottle cages to get rid of stubborn grime effectively\n\n6.When focusing on wheels & tires do not forget both sides plus hubs\n\n7.The drivetrain can be one section where filth accumulates quickly: cassette cogs should be properly brushed together utilizing soapsuds then subsequently rinsed until every bit becomes visibly clean \n\n8.After scrubbing sections including derailleurs/ jockey rollers ensure that they are washed thoroughlyâ€”do remember about cranksets too!\n\n9.Once everything has been cleaned & dried according_to_your_satisfaction reattach important components like battery pack ensuring that everything operates correctly\n\n10.Regular quick checks can aid maintain overall performance therefore always pay close attention towards checking brakes systems along with tire pressure prior going out riding"
