Show empathy: Understand the emotions that are being conveyed by the person talking and try to put yourself in their shoes.\n\n3. Be open-minded: Try not to judge or make assumptions about what is being said but instead stay receptive to different perspectives.\n\n4. Ask for clarification if needed: If uncertain about something mentioned or if a misunderstanding arises, ask for more explanation to ensure complete comprehension of the point being made.\n\n5. Take notes when appropriate: Whether during meetings or lectures, note-taking can help you remember important points discussed and process information better later on.\n\n6. Provide feedback: Acknowledge understanding by responding with thoughtful comments and questions based on what has been said without interrupting frequently.\n\n7. Summarize key points at regular intervals; make sure your interpretation matches others', especially those discussing complex topics like during negotiations/agreements/debriefings after events/projects completed/shared experiences et al., this skill helps reinforce all parties' knowledgebase"
