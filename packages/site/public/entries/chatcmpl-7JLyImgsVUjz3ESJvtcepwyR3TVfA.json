This can be done either by acquiring existing suppliers or creating new units at each stage of the production process.\n\nThe main advantages of vertical integration include:\n\n1. Cost savings: By combining multiple stages of the supply chain within one organization, companies can eliminate middlemen's fees and reduce transportation costs between different facilities.\n\n2. Quality control: Having direct control over every step in their supply chains allows companies to better monitor product quality throughout the entire process and implement improvements more easily where necessary.\n\n3. Supply reliability: Vertical integration ensures that companies always have access to key components needed for their products since they are not reliant on external suppliers who might experience shortages or delays.\n\n4. Improved coordination: Combining several aspects related to producing goods under one management structure enables better communication between departments, leading to more efficient operations overall.\n\n5.EXTRA INFORMATION Protection from competitors: Any potential competitive advantage merchants may gain when purchasing lower-priced inputs from an outside market vanishes if producers decide instead only sell directly.\n \nSome disadvantages & negative impact on businesses:\n \n1.Lack flexibility – Controlling entire supply chain lowers ability adapt quickly changes shifting markets because internalize decision-making vertically integrated firms typically slower change direction than non-integrated ones dealing with independent suppliers customers etc\n \n2.Higher investment risk – Taking possession factories/production plants require large amounts upfront capital expenditure creates significant financial risks especially industries prone rapid technological advancements obsolescence\n \n3.Inefficiencies -companies lose focus expertise smaller specialised sections operational inefficiencies arise area lacks industry knowledge it might struggle performance decline over time cannot deliver economies scale"
