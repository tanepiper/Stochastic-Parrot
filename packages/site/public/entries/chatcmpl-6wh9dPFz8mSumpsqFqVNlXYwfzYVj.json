Ozone layer depletion\n   f. Ocean acidification\n\n2. These environmental issues affect people in several ways:\n    a) They intensify natural disasters: Issues such as climate change contribute to extreme weather events, like hurricanes, droughts, floods, heatwaves and wildfires that cause damage to homes, infrastructure and human lives.\n    \n    b) They threaten health: Increased air pollution can lead to respiratory illnesses like asthma or even lung cancer among vulnerable populations such as children or elderly individuals.\n    \n    c) Water scarcity affects farming and food production: Global warming leads to less snowfall in some areas with glaciers melting more quickly than they should naturally regenerate; this means fewer freshwater resources for agriculture downstream.\n\n3.Contact information:\n  If you want an answer from me specifically through your mobile message service then text \"ARTICLE\" followed by ⟨request⟩(phone number), (area code)-(number).
