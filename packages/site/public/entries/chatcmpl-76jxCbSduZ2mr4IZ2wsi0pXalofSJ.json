Incorrect email or password: Make sure that you are entering the correct email address and master password associated with your LastPass account.\n\n2. Clear browsing history and cache: Sometimes outdated browsing history or a full cache can cause login issues. To fix this, clear your browser's cache and try logging in again.\n\n3. Enable cookies: Some features of LastPass require that your browser has cookies enabled in order for them to function properly. Please check if your browser settings allow third-party cookies from \"lastpass.com\" domains (or simply enable all cookies).\n\n4. Disable problematic security extensions: Certain security extensions might interfere with the operation of LastPass by blocking scripts necessary for proper functioning.\n\n5. Reinstall/remove unsupported configurations/plugins/extensions/etc.: Do a thorough review of software installed on both OS level as well as Browser plugins & Extensions levels which could be interfering with how last pass operates\n\n6. Reset account information:\nIf none of these solutions work, consider resetting your masterpassword/associated Email Account (Note - do it carefully as it will erase vault data). Afterward,a fresh start must be performed setting up new MasterPassword\n\n7.Check Internet Connectivity:\nMake sure device is connected to internet-and access websites freely without encountering any network/failure message notifications.\nReboot Modem/router might also fix connectivity issues sometimes \nPlease remember when changing/updating credentials- give time until next sync occurs on regular interval\n-Re Login after 15min wait period"
