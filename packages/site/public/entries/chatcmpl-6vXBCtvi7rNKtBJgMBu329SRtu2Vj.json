The United States Foreign Service Institute (FSI) classifies languages based on their level of difficulty, and they have determined that Spanish is in Category I - the simplest group.\n\nThere are several reasons why learning Spanish may be easier compared to other languages:\n\n1. It has a straightforward pronunciation and clear phonetic rules.\n2. The grammar structure is reasonably similar to English.\n3.Status as a Romance language means it shares many words with other Latin-derived tongues often encountered by speakers of European languages\n4.there are plenty of resources available to learn this popular language.\n\nOther relatively easy languages for native English speakers include Dutch, Portuguese, Italian, and French.,But overall for vast majority spanish takes top spot among them"
