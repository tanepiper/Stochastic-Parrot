In some contexts, it refers to different levels of heaven or paradise that individuals can ascend through based on their good deeds during their life on earth.\n\nIn Islam, the 7 heavens are part of the Islamic cosmology and represent ascending concentric spheres or dimensions above Earth. According to Islamic belief, each level corresponds to a higher realm inhabited by angelic beings and is presided over by one of Allah's greatest prophets including Adam, John (Yahya), Joseph (Yusuf), Idris Enoch Elijah Moses Aaron Abraham Jesus). These seven layers may be conceptualized as separate worlds or dimensions rather than linear levels that must be traversed sequentially.\n\nIn Judaism, references to multiple heavens can also be found in various texts such as Talmud which also discusses ascending celestial realms Another tradition within Jewish thought speaks of three celestial sanctuaries: Vilon Shamayim Zevul housing throne God himself Raquia makes more explicit mention hierarchy angels appointed realms\n\nThe concept has roots far back ancient Mesopotamian religions where seven-world system was prevalent In Hinduism mention made Mahalokas referred traditionally conceived cosmic divisions Lastly similar idea discussed Norse mythology nine comprising cosmology"
