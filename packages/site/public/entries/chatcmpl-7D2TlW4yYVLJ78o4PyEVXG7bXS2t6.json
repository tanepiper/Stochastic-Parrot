        "content": "Freestyle rapping is a style of improvised rap, often performed without any previously written lyrics or musical accompaniment. It is characterized by its spontaneity and creativity, with the rapper typically improvising their verses and responding to various prompts from the audience or other performers.\n\nFreestyle rappers must possess excellent skills in wordplay, rhyming, storytelling, rhythm and flow to produce relevant content on-the-fly. Freestyling can occur in informal settings like gatherings with friends and hip-hop cyphers (a group setting where participants take turns showcasing their freestyle abilities) or as part of competitive battles between two performers.\n\nTo become better at freestyle rapping:\n\n1.
