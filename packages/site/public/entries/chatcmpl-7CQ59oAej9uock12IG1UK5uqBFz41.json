Single-family home: A standalone house designed for one family, typically featuring a yard and garage.\n\n2. Multi-family home: A building with multiple separate housing units, such as a duplex or triplex, where each unit is occupied by a different family or individual.\n\n3. Condominium (condo): An individually owned unit within a larger multi-unit building, often including shared amenities like pools, gyms and community areas managed by an association of owners through monthly fees.\n\n4. Apartment: A rented living space within a larger building owned by the landlord who might also own other units in the same building; can vary from small studio apartments to large luxury penthouses.\n\n5. Co-housing community: Residents live in private homes but share communal spaces (such as kitchens) and resources, with an emphasis on fostering social connections among neighbors.\n\n6. Tiny house: Small standalone structures typically less than 400 square feet designed for simple living.\n\n7.
