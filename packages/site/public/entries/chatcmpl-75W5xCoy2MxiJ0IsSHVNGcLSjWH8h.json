It refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, caused primarily by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other industrial processes.\n\nThis increase in temperature has led various impacts on our environment:\n\n1. Rising global temperatures: Global average surface temperature has risen by about 1Â°C since the pre-industrial era due to increased greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n2. Sea level rise: Melting ice sheets and glaciers are causing sea levels to rise, which threatens coastal areas with flooding and erosion.\n\n3. Increased extreme weather events: Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, storms (hurricanes/tsunamis), floods which are affecting agriculture production & food security; property destruction cause economic loss for households or indirectly through global financial markets.\n\n4. Ocean acidification: The absorption of excess CO2 by oceans is leading them become more acidic jeopardizing marine ecosystems\n\n5. Wildlife extinction & Biodiversity loss: As many species struggle survive changes their habitats brought warming oceans disrupted ecosystems globally problem extends beyond plant animal wildlife also risks disrupting connections between interconnected survival rely one another mutual benefit resulting collapse entire systems;\n\n6.Human health consequences Aggravation cardiovascular respiratory illness Elevated rates disease vectors Asthma allergies heat related mortality infections transmitted reduction quality sources \n\n7 Forced migration Many lowlying communities already feel pressure uproot roots elsewhere higher ground disrupt social fabric these locations further exacerbates tensions developed countries try cope increasing number migrants Climate refugees`;\n\nUltimately education necessary order understanding ramifications protecting Earth everyone who likes live it only informed we make rational decisions future generations"
