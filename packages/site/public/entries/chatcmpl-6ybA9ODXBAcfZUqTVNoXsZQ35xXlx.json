        "content": "Yes, you can live without a gallbladder. The gallbladder's primary function is to store bile produced by the liver and release it into the small intestine during digestion. If your gallbladder is removed through a procedure called cholecystectomy, your body must adjust to its absence.\n\nAfter removal of the gallbladder, bile flows directly from the liver into the small intestine at a constant rate instead of being stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Most people can lead normal lives without their gallbladders; however, some individuals may experience certain digestive issues initially after surgery until their body adjusts.\n\nIt is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and diet after having your gallbladder removed—particularly avoiding high-fat foods—since digesting fatty meals might be more challenging for some time following surgery. Always consult with a healthcare professional when making changes related to personal health matters like this one!"
