Learn to express your thoughts clearly and concisely, while also taking the time to listen carefully to others.\n\n2. Make an effort to understand others: Empathy is a key component of social skills. Try putting yourself in someone else's shoes and imagine how they might be feeling or thinking in a given situation.\n\n3. Practice active listening: When someone else is speaking, stay engaged by nodding along and maintaining eye contact, asking relevant questions when appropriate, and paraphrasing what they've said to show that you understand their point of view.\n\n4. Maintain good body language: Stand tall with good posture, smile genuinely at those around you (but don't force it), maintain eye contact during conversations without staring intently for too long which may come across as aggressive rather than friendly.\n\n5. Be respectful and considerate of the feelings of others - recognize personal boundaries such as space & tone; avoid interrupting people mid-sentence or dominating interactions/conversations altogether.\n\n6.Start with small talk : Engage confidently in casual conversation with acquaintances by discussing interests—ask about favorite activities/books/movies/etc., inquire about work-related experiences/affairs even if not familiar oneself .\n\n7.Practice making introductions between friends/family members\n\n8.Refine humor usage —avoid offensive jokes/remarks targeted directly toward specific individuals/groups; instead opt tactful plays on words/witty responses thereby adding levity where desired yet maintaining respect-worthiness throughout exchanges .\n\n9.Maintain healthy relationships using emotional intelligence ; learn importance respective preferences /desires/boundaries/preferences differ person-to-person + foster connections accordingly \n\n10.Create opportunities practice expanding network/group settings-volunteer events/social gatherings/local clubs/orgs./meetups/approaching new colleagues willingly/acquiring skillset further development utilizing */\n\nRemember that developing social skills takes time and practice – so keep working at it regularly!"
