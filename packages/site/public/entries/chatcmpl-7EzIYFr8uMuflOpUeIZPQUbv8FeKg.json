        "content": "Country music is a genre of popular music that originated in the southern United States in the early 1920s. It takes its roots from genres such as folk music and blues.\n\nCountry music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars (such as pedal steels), dobros, fiddles, mandolins or basses- it may also feature keyboards like pianos or organs in some songs.\n\nLyrics often focus on themes related to love, heartbreaks or tell stories about rural experiences- alluding to life's ups & downs captured from numerous perspectives including singers /songwriters' own lives plus those they observe around them. Some sub-genres include country pop or rock-a fusion of modern sounds combined with classical twang elements while others explore alternative approaches through \"outlaw country\" emphasizing non-conventional interpretations underscoring artists' individuality & expressionism."
