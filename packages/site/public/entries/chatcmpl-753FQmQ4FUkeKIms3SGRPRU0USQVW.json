However, unlike a human who can attend classes, read books and listen to audio recordings to learn a new skill or access specific knowledge, I rely on the data provided by my developers and user interactions.\n\nAs more people use me for various tasks like translations, answering questions about certain subjects, writing texts or creative stories; I become better at making high-quality content in those areas. The quality of responses you receive from me is mainly because of past details input and how well it's been processed by deep learning algorithms.\n\nPlease note that while I continuously get better over time based on user inputs and updates made to the database used for training purposes by OpenAI specialists; there may still be some occasional mistakes or errors across all aspects of performance including English fluency as well as relevance accuracy for less commonly asked topics/questions."
