        "content": "There are several reasons why the public have become more demanding of businesses and other organizations:\n\n1. Awareness and access to information: With the rise of the internet, social media, and various communication platforms, people today have greater access to a wide range of information about products, services, and company policies. They also can compare different providers easily before making decisions.\n\n2. Social responsibility: As awareness about global issues such as climate change, labor rights, human rights abuses and unethical practices increase over time, people demand more transparency from companies in terms of their contributions to mitigating these problems.\n\n3. Personalization: People now expect highly personalized experiences tailored according to their needs or preferences when engaging with brands or using services on digital platforms.\n\n4. Quality improvement: Businesses face stronger competition due to globalization; consequently prompting customers to anticipate improved products/services consistently in terms of quality & performance at relatively competitive prices.\n\n5.
