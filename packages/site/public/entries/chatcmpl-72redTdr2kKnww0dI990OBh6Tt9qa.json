Weathering occurs in situ (on site) without any significant movement or displacement of rock materials.\n\nProcesses responsible for weathering can be classified into three main categories: mechanical (also referred to as physical), chemical, and biological weathering. These different types work together to break down rock material over time.\n\n1. Mechanical weathering involves the physical breakdown or disintegration of rock material due to various factors such as temperature changes, freeze-thaw cycles (frost wedging), exfoliation caused by thermal expansion and contraction, crystal growth pressure inside cracks, abrasion from wind-blown particles or moving water carrying sediment load etc.\n\n2.
