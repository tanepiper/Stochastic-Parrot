Linguistic determinism: The theory of linguistic determinism suggests that the language we speak influences how we think and perceive reality. According to this view, people who speak different languages would experience the world differently due to differences in vocabulary, grammar, and other linguistic features.\n\n2. Categorization: Languages provide us with categories or labels for organizing information about objects, events, and concepts in the world around us. For example, English speakers use color terms like \"blue\" and \"green\" to categorize colors into distinct groups or categories; these categories might differ for speakers of other languages like Russian which has two separate words for lighter blues (голубой) vs darker blues (синий). This means that language can influence how we group things within specific categories based on semantics.\n\n3. Framing effects: Language shapes our experiences by framing situations in particular ways according to syntax or rhetorical devices used by\n\n4. Culturally related metaphors: In many cultures, certain common experiences are expressed through metaphorical expressions tied specifically to their native language(s). For instance idiomatic phrases or expressions often don't translate directly into another culture's context - hence showing that the way they interpret everyday occurrences is influenced by their linguistic background.\n\n5 Emotional expression: Every culture has its unique set of emotionally-charged words/phrases which is essential when describing certain feelings/incidents shaping one's worldview altogether as well further pushing individuals toward accepting a collective identity overall because identity often correlates quite heavily with emotion-responses throughout life"
