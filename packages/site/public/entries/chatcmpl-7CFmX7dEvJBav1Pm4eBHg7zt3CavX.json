        "content": "Sigmund Freud was very influential in the field of psychology and some would say he was one of the most prominent figures in modern Western thought. His theories primarily deal with human development, unconscious desires, and dream interpretation.\n\nFreud's main ideas include:\n\n1. Psychoanalysis: This is a therapeutic approach for treating mental disorders by investigating repressed emotions or hidden thoughts through techniques such as free association, transference, and dream analysis.\n\n2. Structural model of human psyche consisting of id (instinctive drives), ego (the conscious self) and superego (a moral compass influenced by society). These forces interact to shape an individual's behavior.\n\n3. Childhood stages: According to Freud, individuals go through five psychosexual stages during childhood – oral, anal, phallic, latent period and genital stage – each marked by different conflicts caused by libidinal energy directed toward specific body parts.\n\n4. Oedipus Complex: In this theory mentioned within the context of psychodynamic theory which derived from psychoanalysis; it refers to unresolved sexual feelings that a child may experience toward his/her parent(s) leading to identification with or unconscious rivalry towards them.\n \n5. Repression: A defense mechanism proposed by Freud where unwanted traumatic memories are pushed into the subconscious mind but continue influencing our everyday behavior without us being aware.\n\n6: Dream Analysis - According to Freud dreams acted as \"The Royal Road to subconscious,\" allowing us to find insight into those unconscious thoughts that often can contribute negatively on mental health unless dealt therapeutically beforehand \n\n7- Transference & Counter-transference :  It denotes when patients project feelings about significant others onto therapists; for example anger originally felt towards their parents might be redirected . Therapists also need stay attuned"
