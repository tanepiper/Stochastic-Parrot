They create a strong and long-lasting immune response, providing immunity similar to having the actual disease. Examples include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), yellow fever, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines.\n\n2. Inactivated or killed vaccines: These vaccines are made from viruses or bacteria that have been inactivated or killed by heat, chemicals, or radiation so they cannot cause illness anymore but can still trigger an immune response. Examples include polio (IPV), hepatitis A, and rabies vaccines.\n\n3.
