It is often characterized by colder temperatures, shorter days with longer nights, heavy snowfall (in some regions), ice formation, frosty weather conditions, and sometimes freezing rain or sleet precipitation. \n\nWinter months typically vary depending on geographical location; in most parts of Northern Hemisphere winter lasts from December to February whereas in Southern Hemisphere usually corresponds to June through August.\n\nMany people wear warm clothing such as coats, gloves and hats during this time to stay protected from cold temperatures. Children might enjoy building snowmen or engaging in other outdoor activities like skiing and sledding while adults may battle slippery roads due to ice or snow accumulations.\n\nAdditionally,various animals adopt unique survival strategies during winter period including hibernation (like bears) or temporary migrations towards warmer climates like birds do.\n"
