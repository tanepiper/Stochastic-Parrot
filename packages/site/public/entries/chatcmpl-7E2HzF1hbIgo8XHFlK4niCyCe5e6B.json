Active listening: Give the speaker your full attention by maintaining eye contact, nodding along as they speak, and not interrupting them. This will show that you're genuinely interested in hearing what they have to say.\n\n2. Reflect back: After the person has finished speaking or writing, summarize and rephrase their main points in your own words - this shows that you've been paying attention and clearly understand their message.\n\n3. Validate emotions: Acknowledge any emotions that may be underlying their point of view (e.g., \"That must have been frustrating,\" or \"It sounds like you felt really hurt by that experience\") – this can help the speaker feel understood on a deeper level.\n\n4. Ask questions: If something is unclear, ask for clarification (\"What do you mean when you say...?\") instead of making assumptions about the person's intent or meaning behind their words.\n\n5. Share relevant personal experiences: People often appreciate it when others can relate to their experiences; however, be sure to keep the focus on the other person's story rather than hijacking the conversation with your own anecdotes\n\n6. Be non-judgmental: Approach conversations with an open mind instead of imposing your own beliefs onto others' perspectives – even if we don't agree with someone else's point of view doesn't necessarily mean it isn't valid\n\n7.respect differences: We all come from diverse backgrounds and are shaped differently by our experiences; therefore embrace diversity if opinions differ- try understanding why one thinks different without undermining there PoV\n8.Patients+Tolerance:Intellectual discussions heated up handle it calmly giving space,time"
