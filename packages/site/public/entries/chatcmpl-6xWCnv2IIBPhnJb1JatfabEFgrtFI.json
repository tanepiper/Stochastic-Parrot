Some potential reasons why people enjoy looking at these images include:\n\n1. Aesthetic pleasure: Natural scenes tend to possess a harmonious combination of colors, patterns, shapes, and textures that our brain finds visually pleasing.\n\n2. Relaxation and stress relief: Studies have found that viewing pictures of nature can lower levels of cortisol (a hormone associated with stress) in the body while increasing positive emotions like joy and contentment.\n\n3. Connection to nature: Our ancestors lived more closely with their natural environment than we do today; appealing depictions of untouched wilderness could remind us about our connection to the Earth and other living beings around us.\n\n4. Escapism: When everyday life becomes stressful or mundane, images depicting far-off places serve as an escape mechanism from routine-related woes by offering fresh perspectives on different environments or cultures.\n\n5.Invoking memories: Beautiful pictures may bring back happy recollections from personal experiences or soothing familiarity when recalling memories connected with similar views encountered earlier in life—an effect psychologists call “landmark memory.”\n\n6.Sense of adventure & Wanderlust- Looking at breathtaking landscapes from various parts all over the world arouses one's desire for exploration—viewers might even start planning their next travel destination upon seeing such imagery!\n\n7.Inspiration for Creativity - Artists might find inspiration through photos representing unique aspects often photographing earth's topography sparks ingenuity among painters whose use-colors mimic outdoor palettes/values similar those observed within actual panoramas themselves!\n\n8.Spiritual experience - Viewing exceptional sceneries encourages individuals better understanding fundamental interconnectedness shared amongst humankind+environment=ultimately promotes sense spirituality ties them essence humanity overall well-being collectively"
