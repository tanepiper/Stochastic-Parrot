The main goal of NLP is to create systems that can understand, interpret and generate human languages in a way that is both meaningful and useful.\n\nThere are several tasks involved in NLP, including:\n\n1. Syntax analysis: Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences by breaking them down into their constituent parts like phrases, clauses, or individual words.\n\n2. Semantics: Understanding the meaning of words within context by identifying relationships between words such as synonyms, antonyms or how they relate to other words within a sentence.\n\n3. Contextual understanding: Deducing contextual information from text based on surrounding content or data available outside the given input text, for example user profiles or past conversations\n\n4. Sentiment analysis: Interpreting the emotions conveyed within text by examining word choice; this refers specifically to positive/negative feelings expressed                                 \n      \n5. Machine translation: Translating text from one natural language into another whilst maintaining semantic integrity\n\n6. Named entity recognition (NER): Identifying proper nouns/entities within text e.g., brandsÂ´ names countries cities\n    \n7- Coreference resolution identifies when two entities represent same underlying concept                      "
