This analysis helps companies determine the most attractive options for growth, expansion or investment within specific market segments.\n\nThe goal of market opportunity analysis is to support better decision-making by providing an understanding of various factors that can impact the success of a new product or service. These factors may include customer preferences, competitive landscape, technological advancements, regulations and macroeconomic conditions.\n\nTypically there are main five steps involved in market opportunity analysis:\n\n1. Define your business objectives: Clearly state your organization's goals related to promoting growth through new products or services.\n\n2. Identify potential opportunities: Carry out research targeted at uncovering possible areas where you can create unique value proposition compared to competitors.\n\n3. Analyze external factors: Examine variables outside your control such as emerging trends affecting supply chains (e.g., technology), changing consumer preferences (e.g., demand side) and increasing government regulation levels (e.g., constraints).\n\n4. Evaluate internal competencies: Assess how effectively existing resources align with identified opportunities; this includes staff skills/expertise plus infrastructure needs & capabilities required for successful execution/participation within given sector(s).\n\n5.Evaluate each opportunity against clear criteria â€“ make comparisons/assess data gathered vs predetermined strategic objectives- select best fit based on risk / return profile assessment.\n  \nUltimately , Market Opportunity Analysis should help decision makers redirect company resources towards areas with highest likelihood of achieving sustained revenue gains while avoiding those unlikely to be highly-profitable over time ,thus optimizing resource allocation among competing options available today"
