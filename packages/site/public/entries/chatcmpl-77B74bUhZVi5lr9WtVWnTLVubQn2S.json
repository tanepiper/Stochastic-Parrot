They sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in a ship called the Mayflower and eventually arrived in what is now Massachusetts.\n\nThe Native Americans who encountered these newcomers were initially curious about them but remained cautious due to their experiences with earlier European explorers. The first few years saw periods of tentative interactions between the Native Americans and immigrants marked by occasional clashes.\n\nOver time, several relationships developed between certain Native American tribes (such as the Wampanoag) and colonist groups like Plymouth Colonyâ€™s settlers. This led to an early peace treaty that helped both communities foster cooperation important for survival.\n\nRelations continued evolving over centuries as more Europeans immigrated into America: native populations were pushed further westward by land encroachment or even forced into suffering diseases brought from Europe they had no immunity against; many faced turmoil through wars waged over territory claims on all sides too; enslavement was additionally suffered during colonial eras too despite widespread condemnation amongst indigenous peoples at large today perceiving futures via progressivism ideologies expanding opportunities gradually albeit imperfectly so far - aiming ever better striving further progressively none-the-orders-as-they-begin-setting overarching transformative co-existing realities mutual existence entirely viable respect endeavors most essentially certainly ensuring continuity always dynamically improving significantly meaningfully generally substantially alike beneficial perpetually sustaining harmonizingly effectively nebulously-peaceful communicably regardful increasingly equitably"
