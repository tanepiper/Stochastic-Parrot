Monarchy entails that the office of head of state is usually inherited through familial lineage following hereditary rules and practices.\n\nHere are 5 reasons why some countries still have monarchies:\n\n1. Historical Continuity: Many nations maintain their monarchies primarily for historical purposes â€“ it serves as an enduring tie to their past traditions and legacies. This allows them to preserve their cultural heritage and continue longstanding customs.\n\n2. Symbolic Role: Even in cases where they don't hold real political power (such as constitutional monarchies), a monarchy acts as a symbolic representation of national unity. The non-political role played by the members provides stability and continuity in times of transitions while providing guidance during those changes.\n\n3. Tourism Attraction: Royal families often attract tourists globally who come out to experience the pomp & pageantry associated with traditional ceremonies surrounding sovereign rule; such events may include royal marriages/weddings, funerals/memorials services among several others functions involved around maintaining palaces & Crown properties which contribute economically towards tourism sector.\n\n4.
