Set a budget: Before you start shopping, establish a realistic budget for how much you're willing to spend on furnishings. This will help guide your decisions and prevent overspending.\n \n2. Shop secondhand: Visit thrift stores, consignment shops, and online marketplaces like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace for discounted furniture items in good condition.\n\n3. Prioritize purchases: Identify the essential pieces of furniture that you need first before spending money on decorative or secondary items.\n \n4. Consider multi-functional furniture: Look for versatile pieces, such as sleeper sofas or tables with built-in storage, which can serve multiple purposes and save space.\n\n5. DIY projects: Get creative by repurposing old or inexpensive furniture into something new using paint, fabric updates, or other materials.\n\n6. Sales and discounts: Keep an eye out for sales events at local furniture stores and online retailers to benefit from reduced prices on selected items.\n\n7. Quality vs quantity: Invest in quality pieces that will last longer rather than settling solely on cheaper options which might break easily.\n\n8 . Ask friends and family for hand-me-downs if they have unwanted furniture available (and offer to help move it).\n\n9 . Garage/estate/tag sales - Go around local neighborhoods looking for garage / estate / tag sales where families often sell their gently used stuff cheaply\n\n10 . Trading/bartering services : Offer up something youâ€™re good at maybe graphic design , writing etc in exchange of some piece people may be looking to get rid off\n\n11 . Don't rush : Wait until right deal comes along don't panic purchase all things together"
