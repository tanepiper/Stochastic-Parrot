        "content": "Adding fractions with different denominators requires finding a common denominator, converting the fractions to equivalent fractions with that common denominator and then adding the numerators of these new fractions.\n\n1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of both denominators:\nThe LCM of 3 and 5 is 15.\n\n2. Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction using the LCM as the new denominator:\n\nTo convert 4/3: Divide the LCM (15) by 3; you get 5. Multiply both numerator and denominator of this fraction by that result:\n\n(4 * 5)/(3 * 5) = (20)/15\n\nSo, your first converted fraction is now: \n\n20/15\n\nTo convert -1/5: Divide the LCM (15) by its current denominator, which gives you a result of 3. Multiply both numerator and denominator by that result:\n\n(-1 * 3)/(5 * 3)= (-3)/15\n\nSo, your second converted fraction is now:\n\n-3/15\n\nNow add them together:\n\n20/ fifteen plus -three/fifteen equals=(twenty minus three / fifteen)=(seventeen/fifteen)\n\nAnswer: The sum would be seventeen over fifteen or as an improper mixed number expression it would be one whole number (since there are fifteen fifteenths enough for just one whole amount.) leaving us with two something's left ? Two fifteenths exactly so Answer:, mixed becomes \\boxed{1 \\frac {2}{\\cancel{d}}}"
