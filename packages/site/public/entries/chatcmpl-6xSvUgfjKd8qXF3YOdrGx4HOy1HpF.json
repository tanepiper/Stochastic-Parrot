Corrupted apps or files: Sometimes, apps or files on your device can become corrupted and cause your phone to reboot unexpectedly.\n\n3. Insufficient memory: If your device is running low on available memory, it might struggle with tasks like opening too many apps at once—leading to unexpected reboots.\n\n4. Overheating: Phones that overheat (due to heavy multitasking, a damaged battery, or other factors) might automatically shut down in order not to damage their internal components further.\n\n5. Hardware issues: Damaged hardware – such as a faulty charging port, battery problems, or even water damage – could potentially cause random reboots on devices.\n\n6. Android system glitches/bugs/problems: System operations might be compromised by bugs present within the operating system causing frequent crashes and subsequent reboots of devices involved in those buggy transactions\n\n7. Incompatible third-party applications/widgets : Some third party applications/widgets maybe incompatible with specific phones thereby crashing them more often than expected"
