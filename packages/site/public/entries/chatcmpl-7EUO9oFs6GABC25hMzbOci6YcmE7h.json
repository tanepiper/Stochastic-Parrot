A member of a group or class that makes up a whole; one part of something larger\n2. In politics, it refers to someone who is represented by an elected official or political representative\n\nExample sentences using \"constituent\" as a noun:\n- New technologies are made up of various constituent parts.\n- The concerns of each constituent must be taken into account before making any decisions.\n\nAs an adjective, it means:\n1. Being part of something and contributing to its existence\n2. Relating to the power or right to create laws\n\nExample sentences using \"constituent\" as an adjective:\n- Each party's ideas were important at the conference because they all contributed to the final outcome; their opinions were seen as being constituent elements.\n- The senator believes in giving greater weight to local decision-making in certain areas through constituent assemblies.\n\nSo if you're talking about people within your electorate that you represent, it would make sense for politicians saying 'my constituents,' meaning those people whom they serve and work on behalf of in their particular electoral district or area (using the noun form)."
