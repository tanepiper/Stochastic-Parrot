By feeding the system with musical data and training it to analyze patterns, structures, and various elements of music composition within those samples, a neural network is capable of creating complete compositions or assisting composers by generating unique melodies or harmonies.\n\nProfessional musicians such as David Cope created an AI project called \"Experiments in Musical Intelligence\" that generated music mimicking the style of famous classical composers. Another example includes OpenAI's MuseNet which also composes original tunes inspired by different genres.\n\nHowever, despite these advancements in AI-generated music creation, human input and guidance remain crucial for a pleasing musical experience."
