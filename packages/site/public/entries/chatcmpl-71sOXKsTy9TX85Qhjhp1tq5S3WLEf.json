Open the PDF with Adobe Acrobat Pro.\n2. Click on \"Tools\" in the top-right corner.\n3. Select \"Edit PDF\" under Create & Edit.\n4. In the toolbar for Edit PDF, click on \"Watermark,\" and then click on \"Remove.\"\n5. Confirm removal â€“ A dialog box will appear asking if you want to permanently remove the watermark; select \"Yes.\"\n\nIf this method doesn't work or if you don't have access to Adobe Acrobat Pro, try another online tool such as sejda.com or smallpdf.com (although they sometimes only perform well with text-based watermarks). However, be cautious when uploading sensitive documents online.\n\nAnother option is converting your pdf into an image format (for example, jpg), removing/covering up watermarks manually using photo-editing software like Photoshop or GIMP, and finally converting back to a pdf format once edited appropriately.\n\nPlease note that illegally removing watermarks might lead to copyright infringement issues if they belong to copyrighted material owned by someone else. Make sure you have permission before doing so!"
