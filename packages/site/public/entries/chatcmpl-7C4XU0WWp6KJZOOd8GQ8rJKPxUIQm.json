Therefore, there's no hard and fast rule on how many hours a student should study per day. Some students can excel with just 1-2 hours of intense focused study each day, while others might require more time.\n\nHowever, there are some general guidelines that can be useful:\n\n1. Study regularly: Try to set aside dedicated time for studying every day rather than cramming all your study into one or two days before an exam or assignment due date.\n\n2. Take breaks: Research has shown that taking short breaks between periods of intense focus is better for retaining information and maintaining concentration.\n\n3. Quality over quantity: It's essential to pay attention to the quality of your studying rather than just the number of hours you spend at your desk. By organizing regular intervals focusing well during these periods by avoiding distractions (e.g., social media), you'll end up absorbing more material in less time.\n\n4. Understand your limits: Each person has their optimal amount of daily study time â€“ try not to push yourself beyond this limit as it will likely lead only frustration exhaustion detrimentally affect overall personal well-being academic performance\n\n5 .Adjust based on needs workload difficultly material course sometimes may need put extra other times allow relax bit maintain balance life obligations mental health\n\nA good starting point could allocate weekdays weekends depending factors classes workload extracurricular activities adapt needed find suitable individual A conservative estimate start range might around three progressively increase until figure best Understanding strengths weaknesses way tailor studies oneself achieve-maximum-success"
