In regions like Greater Accra and parts of Northern Ghana, sunny days are frequent as opposed to Cape Coast where rainfall occurs more often during December.\n\nAlthough hot and humid, many people consider visiting Ghana in December because there are a series of exciting festivals taking place at this time, such as Farmer's Day or New Year festivities throughout different regions – just be prepared to experience some rain and stay hydrated!"
