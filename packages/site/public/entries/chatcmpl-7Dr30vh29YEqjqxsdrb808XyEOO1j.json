He is best known for his travels through Asia and his accounts of those journeys in a book titled \"The Travels of Marco Polo.\" This work introduced Europeans to many previously unknown facets of Chinese culture, trade routes, geography and wealth.\n\nIn 1271, Marco Polo embarked on a journey along with his father Niccolò and uncle Maffeo to the East, which lasted for about 24 years. The route passed through the Middle East along the Silk Road before reaching Kublai Khan's court in China. They reached China around 1275 where they served Kublai Khan – the founder and first emperor of Yuan dynasty (Mongol-ruled China). Their services as confidants included diplomatic missions across Asia.\n\nDuring his time at Kublai Khan's court, Marco Polo became fascinated by Chinese society – it's cities were larger than he'd ever seen before; people used paper money rather than coins; other things like coal as fuel source, compass navigation or gunpowder had peaked interest too.\n\nMarco Polo returned to Venice in approximately 1295.
