This individual may present this information internally to their employer or externally to the media, law enforcement agencies, watchdog organizations, or regulatory authorities. Whistleblowers often face retaliation for coming forward with such information, which can include job loss and threats against them and their families; thus they sometimes seek protection under whistleblowing laws designed to protect individuals from these consequences while supporting corporate accountability and transparency."
