        "content": "Kennedy's domestic agenda was known as the \"New Frontier,\" which aimed at improving the economy, education, healthcare, and civil rights. Some of his major initiatives included:\n\n1. Economic growth: Kennedy advocated for economic growth through policies such as tax cuts to stimulate consumer spending, investment in public infrastructure projects to create jobs and spur economic activity.\n\n2. Education reform: Kennedy increased funding for education by creating new programs like Head Start, which provided early childhood education services to low-income families. He also worked towards making higher education more accessible through grants and student loan programs.\n\n3.Civil Rights: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was proposed under President Kennedy's administration but passed after his assassination during Lyndon B. Johnson's term; it outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin.\n\n4.Healthcare reform: He pushed a comprehensive plan that would provide medical insurance coverage options for everyone within a certain income bracket while providing federal aid for elderly citizens and lower-income households who couldn't afford Medicare premiums (the Medicare program).\n\n5.Space exploration: He announced plans in 1961 for landing astronauts on the moon before the end of the decade had arrived; this became one focus area within Americaâ€™s ambitious space race against Soviet Union during Cold War era"
