It combines multiple files along with their metadata, such as directory structures, ownership details, and timestamps, to preserve them in a single archive.\n\nTo create a tar file using the command line in Linux/Unix:\n\n1. Open a terminal window.\n2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your tar file using the `cd` command.\n3. Use the `tar` command followed by flags -cvf ('c' for creating an archive, 'v' for having verbose output showing progress adding files,'f' to specify that we're providing a filename immediately after) and then provide your desired tar filename ending with \".tar\" extension:\n   ```\n   $ tar -cvf archivename.tar /path/to/files\n   ```\n\nExample:\n\nIf you have three folders named: \"folder1\", \"folder2\", \"folder3\" in your home directory \"~/example/\" and you want to create an archive named myarchive.tar from those folders:\n\n```\n$ cd ~/example/\n$ tar -cvf myarchive.tar folder1 folder2 folder3\n```\n\nWhen this is done correctly, you will see output displaying each file being added to the new .tar archive called myarchive.tar\n\nAfter completing these steps successfully, there should be newly created Tar-file inside your current location with given name like \"./myarchive.tar\"."
