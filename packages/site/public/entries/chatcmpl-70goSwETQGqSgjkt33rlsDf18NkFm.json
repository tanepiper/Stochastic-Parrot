Strengthening international coordination between governments, central banks, and regulatory bodies to ensure that national regulation is consistent with global standards.\n\n2. Developing a more robust early warning system for detecting potential threats to financial stability by improving the monitoring and surveillance capacity of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and G20 Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\n3. Improving transparency in the global financial system through better disclosure of information related to risk exposures, balance sheets, derivatives markets, and off-balance-sheet activities.\n\n4. Enhancing macroprudential regulations that aim at addressing systemic risks within the financial sector rather than focusing solely on individual institution-level rules.\n\n5. Promoting comprehensive stress testing for major banks and other financial institutions to assess their vulnerability under extreme economic situations and ensure they have adequate capital buffers in place.\n\n6. Encouraging cross-border cooperation among regulators in resolving failing or troubled large multinational banking institutions without causing excessive market disruption or burdening taxpayers.\n\n7. Ensuring ample liquidity is available within markets during times of crisis by implementing frameworks like standing swap lines between central banks for currency exchanges as part of safety nets against sudden market shocks or disruptions.\n\n8. Curbing excessive leverage used within the financial industry by setting appropriate limits on borrowing levels that may contribute towards asset price bubbles forming due to cheap credit conditions fueling speculative investments â€” thus potentially magnifying future crises when debts rise unsustainably high compared with underlying assets' real value which might later force asset sales further exacerbating overall stresses faced across wider economies impacted accordingly thereafter generally speaking anyway most notably perhaps thereby helping avoid repeating smaller problems growing unnecessarily larger unchecked otherwise following viciously cycles quickly developing via accelerated compounding feedback effect reactions continuously"
