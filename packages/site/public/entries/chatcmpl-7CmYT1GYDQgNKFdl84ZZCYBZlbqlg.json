Genetic predisposition: Some individuals may be genetically predisposed to develop depression based on their family history.\n\n2. Biological factors: Chemical imbalances in the brain, such as low levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, can influence mood regulation.\n\n3. Hormonal changes: Fluctuations in hormones caused by puberty, pregnancy, menopause or thyroid problems can increase vulnerability to depression.\n\n4. Environmental stressors: Life events and circumstances such as job loss, financial strain, relationship issues or trauma can trigger depressive episodes.\n\n5. Chronic health conditions: Those with chronic medical conditions are more susceptible to developing mental health challenges like depression due to the long-term physical symptoms and emotional frustration that comes with ongoing illness management.\n\n6.
