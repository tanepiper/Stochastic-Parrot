Use open-ended questions: Asking open-ended questions is an effective way of introducing new subjects and letting your conversation partner take the lead. For example, you might ask, \"What hobbies or activities have you been enjoying lately?\" \n\n2. Find common ground: Before bringing up a new topic, try to find common ground with your conversation partner that will allow for a natural transition to discuss it.\n\n3. Relate current topics to your intended subject: Evaluate the existing topic of discussion and identify if any elements relate or connect back to the desired subject matter.\n\n4. Share personal experiences or anecdotes related to the new topic: Sharing personal stories could allow for opportunities where others may feel inclined to contribute their thoughts on those given subjects.\n\n5. Utilize segues when transitioning into different subjects: By using words such as 'speaking of' or 'on another note,' one could form transitions between both unrelated and connected themes seamlessly during conversations.\n\nRemember always be mindful of other people's interests and level of engagement when introducing new topics!"
