However, some languages are considered easier for English speakers due to their similarities in vocabulary and grammar:\n\n1. Spanish: As a Romance language, Spanish shares many words with English, making it relatively easy for English speakers to learn.\n\n2. French: Another Romance language that shares significant vocabulary overlap with English.\n\n3. Italian: Italian also related closely through the Latin root connections between both languages.\n\n4. Dutch: A Germanic language closely related to English, making its vocabulary simple to adapt for most learners that have an understanding of either Engish or German origins.\n\n5. Portuguese:The third major romantic European Language that branches off close enough from its relatives (French & Spanish) while still sharing concepts set by Roman ancestry languages such as Greek or Latin words within them simplifying efforts necessary when beginning study at this level!\n\n6 Swedish/Norwegian/Danish - These Scandinavian languages share a lot among each other- including pronunciation rules inherited directly down into syntax which will help those familiarizing themselves quickly pick up skills needed rather than struggle throughout lessons specifically designed around mastering one particular aspect alone without really getting any context across learning material overall allowing students more fluency throughout time spent working toward mastery ultimately creating ability speak intelligibly better than could be expected otherwise given similar background knowledge previously acquired before attempting initial trials furthering comparisons made here giving reason believe these fall place once has taken things else learned apply situation presented itself!\n\nBut remember â€“ ease isn't just based solely upon how we comprehend various factors play role along route undertaken during studying/comprehending content placed field eyesight surrounds us each passing moment despite knowing beforehand would eventually get where wanted go however"
