Poor circulation: Sitting or standing in one position for a long time could compress the blood vessels and nerves, causing temporary numbness in the feet.\n\n2. Nerve compression: Pressure on nerves from tight shoes, swelling or injury could lead to numbness and tingling sensations in the foot.\n\n3. Sciatica: Compression of the sciatic nerve can lead to pain along with tingling, numbing sensations starting from lower back down through leg upto-foot\n\n4. Peripheral neuropathy - A condition caused by damage to peripheral nerves due to diabetes, alcohol abuse or vitamin deficiency among others giving rise to sensory symptoms like burning pain,numbness & tingling predominantly affecting hands& feet.\n\n5).
