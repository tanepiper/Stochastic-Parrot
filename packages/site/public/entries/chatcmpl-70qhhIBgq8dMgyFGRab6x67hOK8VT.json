However, some highly rated feel-good movies you can consider include:\n\n1. The Shawshank Redemption (1994)\n2. Good Will Hunting (1997)\n3. Amelie (2001)\n4. It's a Wonderful Life (1946)\n5. The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)\n6. Forrest Gump (1994)\n7. Little Miss Sunshine (2006)\n\nAgain, I haven't personally watched these films but they are generally considered as inspiring and heartwarming by many people who have seen them.\n\nEnjoy your movie night!"
