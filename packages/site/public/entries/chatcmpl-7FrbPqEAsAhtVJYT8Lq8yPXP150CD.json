The movement revolves around the baseless belief that there is a secret cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles who are conspiring against former U.S. President Donald Trump, who is supposedly fighting back.\n\nMany experts and researchers have debunked QAnon's various claims and labeled it as unfounded or baseless. Additionally, organizations like the FBI have identified potential domestic terrorism threats linked to conspiracy theories like QAnon.\n\nIt's essential to approach such topics with skepticism and critical thinking while relying on credible sources for information rather than being swayed by speculation or misinformation circulating online."
