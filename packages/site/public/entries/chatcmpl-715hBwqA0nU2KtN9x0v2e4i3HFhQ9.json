For example, if a proposal is too abstract or vague, concretizing it involves adding details and clarifying aspects so that it becomes more precise and easy to understand.\n\nIn the context of marketing or advertising, concretization can involve creating specific advertisements, slogans, logos or design elements based on an idea for a product campaign. The goal should be to create concrete examples that illustrate how your company's products/services will appeal to consumers."
