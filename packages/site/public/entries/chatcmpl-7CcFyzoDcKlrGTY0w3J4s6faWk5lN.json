To do so, I have been trained on a diverse range of internet text and hold 175 billion parameters that help me understand context, semantics and syntax.\n\nEssentially, my primary function is to assist users in generating coherent and informative responses in various areas such as answering questions, providing explanations or advice, creating content and more.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that although advanced AI models like me can produce high-quality text responses overall domain knowledge still lacks compared to most humans who are experts in their fields. So please take my answers with a pinch of salt when needed!"
