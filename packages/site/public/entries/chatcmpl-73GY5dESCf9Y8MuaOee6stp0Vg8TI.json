Exposure to different types of texts (e.g., novels, newspapers, magazines) can help you better understand the language's structure and various writing styles.\n\n2. Write daily: Writing allows you to practice constructing sentences and expressing your thoughts in English. You can start by keeping a journal or blogging about your experiences.\n\n3. Watch movies and series in English with subtitles: This will boost your listening skills as well as expose you to informal expressions that may not be covered in textbooks.\n\n4.
