It was previously extensive throughout this river basin, including Colombia and Venezuela. However, due to excessive hunting for their skins in the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as habitat destruction caused by human activities such as dam construction, agriculture expansion, and pollution from mining operations, the population has dramatically decreased.\n\nProtective measures have been taken since the second half of the 20th century to preserve this species. In Venezuela and Colombia's areas where they reside are now considered protected zones with strict regulations against hunting them or disturbing their habitats.\n\nAdditional efforts have included educational campaigns teaching local communities about ecological best practices- like avoiding pollution along riverside farming lands-, supporting national conservation programs around breeding centers like Iván T.\r\nZacarías Camaquen's Caño Coreche center outside El Capricho Matiyure state park at Apure State National Park south-central Eastern Venezuelan Andean region among others which aim for artificially rearing young offspring readying business in wildlife sanctuaries without habituation processes necessary.\n \nDue to these concerted effort laws enforcement incentives environmental monitoring protection mitigation management besides better understanding ecosystem corridor interactions population dynamics impacts threats needs science technology investigation biology ecology recovery patterns social contexts history legend culture development ecotourism initiatives economics benefits fight poverty climate change biodiversity strategic value shared binational policies between Venezueala-Limited resourse play crucial role across South America"
