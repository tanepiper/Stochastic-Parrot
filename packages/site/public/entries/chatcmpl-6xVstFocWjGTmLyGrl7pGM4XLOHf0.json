        "content": "Transaction costs refer to expenses incurred when buying or selling assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate or other goods and services. These costs can include fees paid to intermediaries like brokers who make trades on your behalf, commissions charged by the brokerage firm you use for transactions, taxes levied on purchases and sales of securities (such as stamp duty in some countries), market impact cost (the effect of a large trade moving market prices), and potential lost opportunities due to time delays between execution and settlement.\n\nTransaction costs can be classified into explicit and implicit transaction costs:\n\n1. Explicit transaction costs: These are direct monetary expenses such as broker commissions or other fees that an investor pays out-of-pocket to execute a financial transaction.\n2. Implicit transaction costs: These might not involve direct payments but still impact the efficiency of a trade. For example:\n   - Bid-ask spread: This is the difference between the price at which someone is willing to buy (the bid) and the price at which someone else is willing     to sell (the ask).\n   - Market impact: The effect that a large order has on market prices; larger orders may move markets more than smaller ones.\n   - Opportunity cost: The fact that making one investment typically implies missing out on another potentially profitable opportunity.\n   \nIn most cases, investors seek low-cost options with quick executions while avoiding counterparty risks tied up with executing multiple trades through several vendors; this may result in lower overall investment returns if excessive trading leads high accumulations in commission charges over time.\n\nHaving low transaction costs can help yield higher performance for portfolio managers since they would have less drag from these additional expenses--hence why funds often prefer passive investments strategies rather than engaging active management where turnover rates could blow up net return yields"
