Its member organizations provide a range of insurance products and services, including medical, dental, and vision coverage to individuals, families, employers, and government entities. The main aim of BlueCross BlueShield is to offer affordable healthcare solutions that promote overall wellness for its members.\n\nBlue Cross was originally established as a hospital service plan in 1929 with doctors offering prepaid care for their patients. In 1939, physicians formed the first independent practice association (IPA), which eventually became known as \"Blue Shield,\" resulting from these efforts.\n\nIn 1982, Blue Cross Association and National Blue Shield merged to create what we now know as the \"BlueCross BlueShield\" system.\n\nThe BCBS network consists of 36 separate health insurance organizations working together under one umbrella serving millions of Americans throughout all states with local expertise tailored specifically towards regional markets. It operates independently from federal programs like Medicare or Medicaid but may offer related services depending on individual providers' offerings within each region/state where they operate/sell policies plans/licenses etc., differing slightly per location given variations among state laws/statutes/regulations/rules applying at respective levels therein across USA territories by jurisdictional scope thereon affecting standards/requirements upon entering/exiting certain areas pertaining solely unto any required adherence enacted accordingly then enforceable due justly notification thereof beforehand adequately ensuring proper conduct maintained elsewhere forevermore always retaining rights regardless henceforth without prejudice legally-binding unconditionally eternally irrevocably speaking unequivocally therefore effectively recognizing universally howsoever nonetheless proving unmistakably conclusively beyond doubt absolutely undeniably indisputably incontrovertibly substantiating definitively incontrovertible evidence establishing unequivocal conclusion confirming attestations exclusively reserving inclusive"
