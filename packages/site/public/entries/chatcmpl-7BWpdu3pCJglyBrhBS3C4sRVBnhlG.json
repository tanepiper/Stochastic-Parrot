        "content": "With global warming, sea turtles are affected in several ways:\n\n1. Beach erosion and loss of nesting habitats: Rising sea levels lead to beach erosion, which destroys nesting sites for many marine turtle species. Sea turtles depend on sandy shores for the critical aspects of their life cycle - namely, laying eggs.\n\n2. Temperature-dependent sex determination: The incubation temperature during embryonic development determines the sex of hatchlings in most reptiles including sea turtles. Warmer temperatures produce more females while cooler temperatures result in males; a balanced ratio is essential to maintain sustainable populations.\n\n3. Altered reproductive cycles and hatching success: Higher sand temperatures can harm embryo viability by affecting metabolic rates or causing the generation of harmful substances within the egg chamber, leading to reduced hatching rates or survival potential of hatchlings.\n\n4. Changes in food availability and habitat range: Climate change affects ocean currents, chemical composition (ocean acidification), water temperature, and migratory patterns that adversely impact feeding sites or create mismatches between migration timing & seasonal shifts impacting prey abundance/distribution.\n\n5. Increased frequency and intensity of storms: Extreme weather events like hurricanes can disrupt nesting seasons by eroding beaches or promoting flooding â€“ both diminishing available breeding grounds for sea turtles or severely impacting nests during an active season (e.g., destroying/immersing eggs).\n\n6. Coral reef degradation due to rising ocean temperatures: A significant proportion of turtle diets include resources from coral reef ecosystems - further decline could put additional stress on already vulnerable populations reliant on these sources as well as alter behavioral patterns such as mating competition strategies linked with territory/resource usage post-maturation stages among members from different sub-populations inhabiting reefs concomitantly whose social structures may be disrupted following changes induced through anthropogenic influence related"
