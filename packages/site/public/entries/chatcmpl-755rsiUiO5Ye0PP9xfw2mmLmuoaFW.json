Functionality and features: The more complex the app, with more features and functionalities, the higher the cost.\n\n2. Platform: Developing an app for multiple platforms (iOS, Android) will increase costs as it requires additional coding and resources.\n\n3. Design complexity: A basic design may be cheaper to develop than a highly-customized design with unique elements or complicated graphics.\n\n4. Development team location: Hiring developers from different countries can affect rates due to differences in wages and living standards.\n\n5. Outsourcing versus in-house development: Building an app with an internal team might require hiring new employees, while outsourcing could lead to lower labor costs but less control over project management.\n\n6. Maintenance & updates: Regular maintenance expenses will raise overall costs; these include bug fixes or software upgrades needed after launch due to evolving technology trends or user needs changes since initial deployment.\n\n\n\nOverall price ranges vary widely depending on these factors â€“ you might expect relatively simple apps under $10k at low end/freelancer work rate exchanges up through large-scale enterprise projects well over $100k+ if outsourced off-shore skilled company managed teams were utilized efficiently per specifications outlined here above notably itemized specifics enumerated bulleted variables abstracted plus others otherwise metrics measurements vs broad-swag guesstimates generalized declarations available comparatively against bespoke tailored agreements stipulated requirements as charged reviewed accordingly estimated calculated value range proposed total derived envelope numbers arrived computed dimensions appropriate size-based magnitude correlated predominantly baseline absolute sum accrued comparable estimates mentioned obtained herein averaging equivalents expressed determined global market conditions current calculate aforementioned prevailing standard local region union domicile business commercial entity based obligations complied quality assessment contractual legally binding terms endorsed approved mutually agreed upon signatories"
