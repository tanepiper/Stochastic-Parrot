Therefore, they are considered safe and non-toxic for humans and animals alike. The seeds of sunflower are consumed by people as well as birds because of their nutritional value. However, it is always a good idea to practice caution while introducing new food items in one's diet since some individuals may be allergic to certain plant material or its pollen."
