However, we can provide some insight into the approximate numbers involved.\n\nUnder normal conditions at rest:\n- An average adult breathes about 12 times per minute.\n- Each breath has a volume of approximately 0.5 liters (500 milliliters). Therefore, in one minute, an individual inhales around 6 liters (12 x 0.5) of air.\n\nThe atmosphere contains about 20.8% oxygen by volume - so there are around:\n(6 liters of inhaled air/minute) * (20.8/100) ≈ 1.25 liters of pure oxygen gas/min\n\nNow let's convert this to moles:\n\n1 mole = approx ==22litres\n\nx = amount_moles_in_liter\ndx=28mole/liter₁ \n\n=> any_time_you_breathe_times_**a_vinous_calculation'**\n\nHowever, keep in mind that not all the oxygen is actually used or extracted from each breath; our bodies only utilize about ~one quarter for oxidation process converted through cell respiration to energy and carbon dioxide before it dissipates'' – back out when we exhale So roughly speaking**,the consumption is close but will take significantly less.hence please consider those approximation before you presume numberWithInt"
