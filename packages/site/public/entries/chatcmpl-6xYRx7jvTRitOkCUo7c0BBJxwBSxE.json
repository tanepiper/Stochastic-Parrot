Territorial disputes: Conflicts often arise when two or more nations claim ownership over a piece of land or territory, such as the ongoing dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan.\n\n2. Resource competition: Countries sometimes fight to control valuable resources like oil, gas, minerals, water sources, fertile lands, fishing grounds etc., which are needed for economic growth and development.\n\n3. Nationalism & ethnocentrism: Strong patriotic feelings in a country can lead to conflict with other nations if they feel threatened by their neighbours' nationalism. Similarly, ethnocentric beliefs that one's ethnic group is superior to others can breed tension among neighbouring countries sharing different cultures/ethnicities.\n\n4. Historical animosity & unresolved issues: Many global conflicts have roots in past grievances between nations based on historical events (e.g., colonisation) and/or previously-seated disputes that haven't been adequately resolved.\n\n5. Political ideology differences: Disagreements about how government should function or differing ideas about the proper role/course a nation should take may lead to conflict between states - e.g., Cold War-era tensions fuelled by communism vs capitalism ideologies/issues around democracy promotion/stability assistance efforts.\n\n6.Role of religion: In some cases religious difference and attitudes play an important part in creating antagonism/conflict; this can be seen with longstanding problems/events throughout history involving religiously-diverse communities/nations/groups/historic instances cultural/political (civilisational) faultlines contending against each other(conquerers/imperialists along Islam-Christianity boundaries...etc).\n\n7.Politics/power struggles within/among countries' ruling elites/dominant factionscan cause strife"
