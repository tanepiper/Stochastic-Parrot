Communicate: Initiate an open conversation with your manager about their behavior and how it affects your ability to perform at work. Try to understand the reasons behind their micromanagement and share your perspective about how you would prefer to be managed.\n\n2. Demonstrate competence and reliability: Prove that you can handle tasks responsibly by consistently delivering quality work, meeting deadlines, and communicating effectively.\n\n3. Document everything: Keep clear records of all instructions given, decisions made, email communications, etc., so you have evidence if there is ever any confusion or claim of wrongdoing later on from either side.\n\n4. Be proactive in reporting progress: Update your manager regularly on the status of projects without being asked. This will show them that you're focused on getting things done well and also alleviates their need for constant check-ins.\n\n5. Anticipate questions or concerns: Address potential issues before they arise by anticipating what might concern a micromanager who pays close attention to detailâ€”this can help prevent last-minute changes after substantial effort has been invested in completing an assignment as instructed\n\n6.Set boundaries assertively but respectfully let him know when his approach becomes condescending\n\n7.Seek feedback actively asking for constructive criticism ilt openly which will make him happy preventing misunderstandings"
