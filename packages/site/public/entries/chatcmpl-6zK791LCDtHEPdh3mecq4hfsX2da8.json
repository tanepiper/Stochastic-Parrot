Age - The site dates back to around 9600-7000 BCE (Pre-Pottery Neolithic), making it over 12,000 years old. This predates many other well-known ancient sites like Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids by thousands of years.\n\n2. Advanced architecture - Despite its age, Göbekli Tepe consists of large-scale megalithic constructions and circular enclosures with T-shaped limestone pillars weighing up to 20 tons each. Such architectural feats were previously thought to be beyond the capabilities of early human societies without advanced agricultural systems.\n\n3. Early evidence for religious practices - Many archaeologists believe that Göbekli Tepe was primarily a religious center due to its lack of settlements and residential structures. Carvings of animals on numerous stone pillars suggest potential connections between an early form of religion or spirituality and animals.\n\n4. Societal organization - The construction involved in creating Göbekli Tepe challenges traditional beliefs about early human societies being small groups based solely on hunter-gatherer lifestyles rather than larger communities capable of monumental projects that require coordination among people.\n\n5.Attribute initiation process leading towards Agriculture- Researchers think that this place could also signify a crucially important initiation stage where humans moved from hunting-gathering food practices towards settling down into agriculture-based civilization slowly paving way towards modern organized society as we witness today!\n\nIn summary, Göbekli Tepe changes our understanding about humanity's social evolution from traditionally accepted notions forcing us to realise how archaic religions played significant roles even at the earliest phases!"
