Open your Firefox browser.\n2. Navigate to the website you would like to start with by typing its address into the address bar or searching for it through your preferred search engine.\n3. To open a new tab, click on the \"+\" symbol located at the top of the browser near your current tabs. You can also use Ctrl+T (Cmd+T on Mac) as a keyboard shortcut for opening a new tab.\n4. Once you have opened another tab, repeat step 2 â€“ enter another website's address or perform a search to navigate to that site within that second tab.\n5. As needed, continue opening more tabs and navigating to websites by repeating steps 3 and 4 above.\n\nTo switch between different open tabs:\n\n1. Simply click on an individual tab's title at the top of your screen\n2. Alternatively, use keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Tab (Ctrl+Shift+Tab in reverse order) on Windows/Linux or Cmd +Option + right arrow (Cmd +Option + left arrow in reverse order)on Mac.\n\nRemember not all sites are immediately compatible without desktop version with mobile apps so make sure first if certain URL can be visited via iPad device due its possible limitations regarding web browsers functionality accessibilities and rendering capacity differences compared against classical operative systems environments loaded devices configuration schemes inclusive some features aren't completely available across portable equipment versions such Mozilla code adapted solutions context compatibilities exigencies restrictions from Apple made gadgets technical specifications enforcement necessities related policies constraints circumstances establishment requirements central structures determinations implementations indications mandates parameters agreements actual disposition condition execution stages constitutional efficacy acknowledgement essential partnership establishments necessary adjustments permissions approvals adjusted"
