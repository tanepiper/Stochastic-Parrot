Public awareness campaigns: Educate people through billboards, posters, pamphlets, social media and other platforms about safe driving practices and the dangers of speeding, drunk driving, not wearing a seatbelt, distracted driving etc.\n\n2. Strict enforcement of traffic rules: Implementing stricter fines and penalties for traffic rule violations can act as a deterrent for reckless drivers.\n\n3. Regular maintenance of roads: Properly maintained roads with ample lighting at night and visible signage can help prevent accidents.\n\n4. Pedestrian safety measures: Installing pedestrian crossings, footpaths/sidewalks and speed bumps near residential areas or schools keep pedestrians protected from fast-moving vehicles.\n\n5. Improved vehicle standards: Vehicles should be regularly checked for faults that could increase the risk of an accident (such as faulty brakes or broken headlights).\n\n6. Special training programs/courses on defensive driving techniques for new drivers, professional drivers such as truckers or taxi/rideshare drivers.\n\n7. Promote use of public transportation systems like buses or trains which will lead to fewer vehicles on the streets thereby reducing chances of collisions between cars/motorbikes/pedestrians/etc..\n\n8. Employ technology solutions such as collision detection systems in modern vehicles that warn/alert the driver if they are too close to another car/object/person/signalling them when it is unsafe to change lanes/pass/etc.."
