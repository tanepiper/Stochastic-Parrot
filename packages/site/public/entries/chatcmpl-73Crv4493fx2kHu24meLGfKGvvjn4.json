The antonym of plausible would be implausible, which means unlikely, far-fetched or not believable.\n\nHere are some sentence examples:\n\n1) His explanation was quite plausible and convinced most people.\n2) She provided a plausible reason for her absence from the meeting.\n3) Their story seems plausible but requires further investigation to confirm it.\n4) Although his alibi sounded convincing at first glance, further questioning revealed that it was completely implausible."
