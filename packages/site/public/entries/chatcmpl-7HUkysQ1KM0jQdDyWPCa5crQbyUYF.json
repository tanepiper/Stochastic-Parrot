He received his Ph.D. from Oxford University and is currently a professor of philosophy at Florida Atlantic University. His interests span the fields of art theory, ethics, social concepts (such as race), somaesthetics (the aesthetic experience of bodily sensations), and applying philosophical thought into craft or artistic practice.\n\nShusterman has authored several influential books such as \"Pragmatic Aesthetics: Living Beauty\" and \"Performing Live,\" which address how art can transform society by enhancing life experiences through new ways of thinking about beauty while understanding different cultures' values concerning aesthetics.\n\nSome major themes found in both traditional Western aesthetics but also establishing a comparative approach with other traditions include:\n\n1. The power of reflection: Aesthetic experiences become more profound when individuals engage actively in analyzing their own perceptions rather than merely passively consuming art.\n2.
