Find a flat surface in your freezer where the container can fit and be stable. Clearing any items in its way might help.\n\n3. Fill the container with water, just about an inch deep, then place it back into the flat space inside of your freezer until frozen solid.\n\n4. Next, remove it from the freezer and get ready to prepare your desired ice cream mix.\n\n5. Place cone-shaped molds on top of this first layer - this will give each scoop molded shape when placed into waffle cones later! Make sure they are properly secured so that they sit balanced on top; alternatively, you could use differently shaped silicon custard cups/muffin liners instead of actual molds if those aren't available to you at home!\n\n6. Pour prepared ice cream mixtures gently down each opening slowly without disturbing either their position atop aforementioned layer nor pre-existing icy contents now beneath them - basically aimful dispensing must occur throughout labors lasting anywhere between five minutes onward depending upon our own specific processes incorporated here!.\n\n7 .
