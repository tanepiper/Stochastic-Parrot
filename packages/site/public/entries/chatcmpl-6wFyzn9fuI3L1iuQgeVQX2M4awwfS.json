This technology allows players to interact with games by using their body movements as inputs.\n\nThe Xbox 360 Kinect features an RGB camera for capturing video signals, an infrared (IR) depth sensor that emits IR light and measures the time it takes for light to reflect off objects, returning back to the sensor. By comparing these two sources of information - color image data from the RGB camera and distance data collected by IR sensor – Kinect creates a detailed point cloud map containing millions of points representing individual positions within its field of view.\n\nThis point cloud is then used by custom-developed software algorithms that interpret user's gestures such as arm movements, jumping or kicking actions into corresponding actions on screen. Additionally, this same set-up also enables facial recognition capabilities; allowing gamers’ avatars to imitate their unique expressions during gameplay sessions.\n\nMicrosoft developed advanced skeletal tracking technology which identifies up to twenty key joints on human bodies enabling system’s ability not only respond accurately but also smoothly follow your movement reproducing them almost real-time providing natural game experience without need hold any controllers at hand whatsoever-except maybe occasionally shake fist when somebody beats another high-score again!"
