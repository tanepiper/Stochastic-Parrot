However, based on what people typically enjoy in a synthesizer, they may look for qualities such as high-quality sounds and ease of use. Additionally, popular synthesizers usually allow users to create various patches and textures while offering a customizable design to help them achieve their creative goals.\n\nSome well-regarded software synthesizers include Serum by Xfer Records, Massive by Native Instruments,and Sylenth1 by LennarDigital, among others. Keep in mind that the \"best\" software synthesizer varies depending on individual preferences and musical styles.\n\nVST stands for Virtual Studio Technology – it is a plugin interface created by Steinberg Media Technologies that integrates digital effects processing and virtual instrument synthesis into music production environments such as DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) or other audio editors.\n\nA VST host is a program or application that supports loading VST plugins – this includes DAWs like Ableton Live, FL Studio or Cubase – but also standalone applications specifically designed for live performance like Mainstage 3 from Apple Inc. So when someone refers to using 'hardware free,' they imply using only software-based instruments with no additional physical hardware components involved in sound generation."
