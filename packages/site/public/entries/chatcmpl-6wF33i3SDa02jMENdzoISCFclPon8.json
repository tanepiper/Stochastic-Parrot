This period of time is used as a basic unit of time in many calendar systems worldwide.\n\nSeasons on the other hand are caused by various factors such as differences in sunlight distribution resulting from Earth's axial tilt and elliptical orbit. In several parts of the world, there are four distinct seasons: spring, summer, autumn (or fall), and winter. Seasonal changes occur due to fluctuations in temperature and weather patterns throughout our planet's yearly orbit around the Sun.\n\nWhile both concepts depend on Earth's revolution around its star, they serve different purposes:\n\n1. The solar year provides information about how long it takes for our planet to complete an orbit; this knowledge helps us create accurate calendars.\n2. Seasons inform us about variations in climate experienced across specific regions within a given timeframe (i.e., seasonal changes)."
