To strike a balance between these goals, decision-makers can promote environmental sustainability while prioritizing social justice.\n\nSome ways to achieve this include:\n\n1. Encourage sustainable development: Governments can establish policies that encourage sustainable resource use and energy-efficient technologies (e.g., renewable energy). This not only helps protect the environment but also generates new job opportunities for low-income communities, thus alleviating poverty.\n\n2. Implement progressive regulations: Strong environmental laws regarding pollution control can benefit both human health and ecosystems. Moreover, by enforcing compliance with such regulations among big corporations and industrial polluters, governments can level the playing field for smaller businesses that may struggle in an unregulated market.\n\n3. Invest in education: Increasing access to quality education ensures people have better skills, knowledge of their rights, and awareness of sustainable living options; empowering them with greater income prospects as well as tools making informed decisions benefiting themselves & their environment.\n\n4. Promote fair labor practices: Ensuring fair wages & working conditions will help reduce income disparities leading towards poverty eradication promoting social upliftment essential for generating resources required maintaining environmentally responsible lifestyles\n\n5. Support community-driven initiatives: Empowering local communities enables them find solutions reflecting unique socio-economic contexts considering ecological sensitivities effectively addressing inequalities arising from unsustainable consumption patterns hazardous consequences on environments resultantly catering both concerns simultaneously\n\n6- Provide universal healthcare offering basic services guarantees marginalized populations required medical care easing financial burden thus contributing implicitly systemic efforts alleviating indigence ensuring healthy population becomes mindful natural surroundings adopting good practices suiting green paradigms most importantly makes it easier adjust governmental focus mitigation strategies demanding strong commitment larger populace inclusive growth devoid deleterious regional impacts"
