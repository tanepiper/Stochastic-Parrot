        "content": "Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, which store genetic information in all living cells. They consist of three components: a nitrogenous base, a sugar molecule (either ribose or deoxyribose), and one to three phosphate groups. The visible structure of nucleotide consists mainly of the sugar molecule linked with both the nitrogenous base and phosphate group.\n\nThe function of nucleotides is not only to form long chains known as polynucleotide strands that make up DNA and RNA molecules but also they perform other vital functions such as acting as chemical signals (e.g., cyclic AMP) or being part of critical intracellular processes like energy metabolism (e.g., ATP). Additionally, special types of nucleotides serve roles in cellular defense mechanisms by aiding the repair of damaged DNA."
