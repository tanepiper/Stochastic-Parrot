Four-of-a-kind or Quads – Four cards of the same rank\n4. Full house – Three cards of one rank along with two cards from another rank\n5. Flush – Any five non-consecutive cards from a single suit.\n6. Straight – Five consecutive ranked cards without being suited (example: 3-4-5-6-7)\n7. Three-of-a-kind or Trips/Set - Three matching-ranked poker cards accompanied by two unmatched/unrelated sidecards \n8.Two pair - Two distinct pairs in one hand accompanied by a fifth card as kicker \n9.One Pair– contains just a single pair along with three unrelated sidecards\n10.High Card– A hand that does not have any other higher-ranking combination and is named for its highest value card\n\nThe best possible respective hands vary significantly depending on whether you prefer playing games with wild-card options or bring various variables into play such as hi-lo split pot specifications.\n\nIt's important to note that these rankings generally apply when comparing individual hands in most poker games including Texas Hold'em and Omaha hold 'em among others; however some variations may have alternate rulesets which results different ranking systems emerging throughout history due their contextually driven popularity within unique cultures"
