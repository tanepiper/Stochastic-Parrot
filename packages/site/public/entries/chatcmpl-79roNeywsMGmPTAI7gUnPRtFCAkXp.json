Injury: If the person has suffered a significant injury to their leg, such as from a sprain, bruise or fracture, it is common for the tissue surrounding the injury to become inflamed and swollen.\n\n2. Infection: An infection in the skin of the leg can also cause swelling. This may be due to an insect bite or a cut that has become infected.\n\n3. Fluid retention: Called edema, this occurs when excess fluid becomes trapped in your body's tissues -- which can lead to swelling in various parts of your body including legs and feet.\n\n4. Vein issues: Problems with veins (such as varicose veins) can also cause fluid buildup within affected limbs leading to lymphedema.\n\n5.
