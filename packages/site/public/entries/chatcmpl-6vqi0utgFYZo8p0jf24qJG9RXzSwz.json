        "content": "Yes, passive voice can convey distance in academic writing. The use of the passive voice can help create a sense of objectivity and formality, which is sometimes desirable in academic contexts. It shifts the focus away from the individual or entity performing an action to the action itself, providing a more neutral tone.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Active voice: \"We conducted research on climate change.\"\n- Passive voice: \"Research on climate change was conducted.\"\n\nIn this case, using passive language detaches the author from the subject matter and presents it in a more detached manner . However, overusing passive constructions could make text harder to read and understand at times. Therefore you need consider when it might be advantageous based upon context audience expectations."
