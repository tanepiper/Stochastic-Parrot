Privacy and anonymity: Cash transactions do not require identification and leave no digital trace, allowing individuals to make purchases without being tracked.\n\n2. No technology needed: Cash can be used by anyone, regardless of whether they have access to technology such as smartphones, credit cards, or the internet.\n\n3. Universally accepted: Almost every business and individual in the world accepts cash payments, making it a universally recognized currency (in local denominations).\n\n4. Reliability during emergencies: In situations where electricity or electronic payment systems fail due to natural disasters or technical issues, cash is often the only viable method of payment.\n\n5. Faster transactions for small amounts: For smaller purchases such as when tipping service staff or buying from street vendors, using cash can be quicker than waiting for card authorization/payment transfer online.\n\n6. Helping manage personal finances better: Some individuals find that only carrying a certain amount of cash helps them stick to their budget more effectively since there's a limit on how much money they can spend at any given time compared with always having access via cards/gadgets connected with online wallets/bank accounts directly\n7.Cost-effectiveness : Many times using digital methods for high-frequency low-value denomination causes inconvenience transaction costs which encourages users towards utilizing hard currency\n\nOverall there is certain advantages tied up with usage & practicality which enables 'Cash' retain its value among modern-day consumers"
