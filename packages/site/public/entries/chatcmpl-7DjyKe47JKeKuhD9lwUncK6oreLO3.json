There are many types of math, including algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, probability theory, number theory, and more. Some other prominent branches of mathematics include:\n\n1. Arithmetic: This branch deals with numbers and numerical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\n2. Trigonometry: It involves the study of angles and their relationships to triangles.\n\n3. Discrete Mathematics: This field encompasses topics like graph theory (study of graphs), set theory (analysis of sets) and combinatorics (arrangements).\n\n4. Real Analysis: A type of mathematics dealing with the real number system along with concepts such as continuity and limits.\n\n5.Vector Calculus:\nVector calculus studies vector fields in multivariable settings applying differentiation & integration over them\n\n6 Topology:\nTopology studies properties conserved under continuous deformations; focused on spaces or objects transformed into various forms\n\n7.Differential Equations:\nDifferential equations involve equations consisting using functions having derivatives; useful in solving practical problems relating rate changes\n\n8.Mathematical logic:The foundation for all mathematics involving symbolic logic propositions \n\n9.Applied Mathematics:Numerical analysis & optimization use computation skills to model real-world situations enhancing decision-making  \n\n10.RowHeadersch 리버 포의 걸 다 계에 비롯 된 간고리 유니 그타 재속리 골라 사가ㅣ 어도 공자 소하 수학으 로네 이때 및 나주 응앤티개어아 연통 시른 새루 게재 다시 도해 감야 주용 하이 등인 대"
