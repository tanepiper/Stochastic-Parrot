Containers are lightweight, portable units that allow developers to package their applications along with all libraries, dependencies, and configurations required to run them.\n\nKubernetes was originally developed by Google in 2014 but later donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It has become increasingly popular among organizations looking for a powerful solution for managing large-scale microservices-based applications.\n\nHere's how Kubernetes works:\n\n1. Containerized Applications: Developers create container images using Docker or other container runtime engines. These images include everything an application needs to run.\n\n2. Clusters and Nodes: Kubernetes deploys containers on clusters made up of nodes (physical or virtual machines) which provide computing resources required for running your applications. Each node runs \"kubelet,\" an agent responsible for maintaining the desired state of each pod running on that node.\n\n3. Master Node: The master node is responsible for managing cluster-wide tasks such as monitoring overall health, orchestrating deployments/upgrades/rollbacks/updates/scaling/auto-scaling tasks over worker nodes containing actual running instances/pods/statefulSets/etc..\n\n4.Query Language: YAML manifest files describe desired configuration like pods number/service load balancing policy/storage/memory settings/API version/etc.. , passed-on via CLI/webUI/dashboard add-ons/Helm/Curl commands etc interacting securely through APIs/api-service …\n\n5.Pod-Autoscaler-Controller checks constantly real-time requirements(logic coded based on parameters like ‘required') vs un-used system capacity; if spare capacity can be reduced then passes requests towards reducing resource allocations declared earlier(increasing efficiency); If higher demand than provisioned then"
