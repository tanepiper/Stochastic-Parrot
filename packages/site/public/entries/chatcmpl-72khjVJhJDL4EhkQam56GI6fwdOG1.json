Lemon juice does have some health benefits due to its high content of vitamin C and antioxidants, but it cannot protect against or cure COVID-19.\n\nCOVID-19 prevention methods include frequent handwashing, wearing a mask in public spaces, practicing social distancing by staying at least six feet away from others, and getting vaccinated when eligible.\n\nTreatment for COVID-19 depends on the severity of symptoms and may include rest, hydration, over-the-counter medicines for fever relief, and medical intervention such as supplemental oxygen or antiviral medications in severe cases.\n\nIf you are concerned about your risk for COVID-19 or suspect that you may be infected with the virus, contact a healthcare professional."
