Security measures: Implement a robust security system, including cameras, motion sensors, and alarms in susceptible areas. Monitor these systems regularly and respond quickly when triggered.\n\n2. Lighting: Ensure that vulnerable locations are well lit at all times. Thieves are less likely to target easily visible spots.\n\n3. Fencing: Build secure, high-quality fences around sensitive locations to keep potential thieves out.\n\n4. Marking and tracing: Permanently mark cables with identifying labels or paint so that they can't be mistaken for scrap metal at recycling facilities or sold easily on the black market.\n\n5.Relative position/location - Make sure your pipes/wires hidden away inside walls if possible by covering them up with concrete pours or crushed rock packets as appropriate rather than leaving exposed access points open where thieves could do damage undetected until it is too late\n\n6.Raise alarm/alert if necessary â€“ If someone does try tampering physical barrier put place then an audible siren should sound immediately scare off would-be criminals warn authorities same time speed which law enforcement responds scene crime hopefully preventing more significant losses occurring down line"
