In a 60 oz mixture, we can calculate each possibility as follows:\n\nFor a 1:1 ratio:\n- You would need equal amounts of sugar and water.\n- Divide 60 oz by 2 to find that you need 30 oz each of sugar and water.\n\nFor a 2:1 ratio (sweeter):\n- You would require twice as much sugar compared to water.\n- Divide the total ounces into three parts (because there are two parts for sugar and one part for water).\n   \n   Which is -> (60 รท3) \n\n   Now multiply this result by two\n\n    &(20 ร2) = \n   \n\nSo for the sweeter syrup with a ratio of 2:1 , you will have :-\n40oz of Sugar\n20oz Water"
