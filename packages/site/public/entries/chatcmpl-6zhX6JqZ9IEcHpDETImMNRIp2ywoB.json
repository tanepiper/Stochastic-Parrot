Lack of empathy and understanding: Emotions help us empathize with others and understand their feelings, thoughts, and actions. If we did not have emotions, it would be difficult to feel for or relate to other people's experiences, which could make our social interactions less meaningful.\n\n2. Ineffective communication: Emotional expressions serve as a form of non-verbal communication that helps convey information within social interactions. Without them, individuals may struggle to communicate their thoughts accurately or interpret the emotional signals from others correctly.\n\n3. Difficulty in decision-making: Emotions can inform personal judgments when used alongside reasoning processes; hence they can sometimes facilitate better decision-making processes. The absence of those influences might result in poor decisions or difficulties making choices.\n\n4. Loss of motivation and drive: Positive emotions such as happiness, pride or excitement often provide personal motivation for achieving goals; conversely negative emotions like anger prompts addressing problems etcetera â€“ without these emotional drivers life could lack purpose or any sense\n\n5 . Challenged relationships and bonding: Feelings like love, compassion , intimacy etc play vital roles sustaining long term partnerships/ friend groups growing cohesively together over time meaning interpersonal was challenging lacking natural emotion-based glue holding them intact\n\n6 .
