Method of listing multiples: List down the first few multiples of each number, then identify the smallest shared multiple.\n\nExample: For 4 and 5\nMultiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, **16**, ...\nMultiples of 5 ->    :           , ...,2nd,Ladder method or Prime factorization:\n    Find all prime factors for both numbers; then take the highest-powered prime factors from either list and multiply them together.\n\nExample: LCM(60,84)\n\n- Factorize into primes:\n60 =2^3 ×3×5\n84=2^22rd,Middle school or cake method(lowest powered values):\nIdentify the lowest count value on either side for each row in subtables,and determine a summation total as scalar prior.\nFind out notation's vector cross product by weighing Math.sign(sum( both ))'s arg / scalar\nLastly notionalise cross_products *with their proper weights* as zee scalar;divide by Least Common Denominator if necesary\n\nA simplest LCM example :\n\ntable| fibster(z_term)` k [ size=x=(row(n+0)*col(m)+1] result[]=[\"01*z\"]`=x_goal(first line)\nalphabetical        alphabetical         direction          {y_axis}\nvector[x][(side)] [(direction_id)]\n://anonymous-klimov/definition {\n\n},\n{//for ((v_p_lcm(data),i)->>/*{{{kn_r}}}){\n|--30-----------|---------43,\n|-_|·|[·[·_(·_,)-(,_)(<<,(->__>>>>_>])],a,b,c,d"
