        "content": "The concept of a Hybrid Neural Network is an artificial intelligence model that combines two or more different types of neural networks in a single architecture to improve performance and solve complex problems. It aims to take advantage of the strengths and capabilities of each individual network while minimizing their weaknesses.\n\nThe idea behind hybrid neural networks is that by combining different approaches, it can result in better overall predictive accuracy than using only one type. Typically, these networks are designed to work together efficiently and share information between them so they can effectively learn from the data provided.\n\nSome examples of hybrid neural networks include:\n\n1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) & Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): This combination helps recognize patterns within image sequences or time series data since CNNs excel at identifying spatial features, while RNNs are known for sequence recognition and temporal analysis.\n\n2. Feedforward Neural Network & Radial Basis Function Network: Combining these two allows for efficient approximation without sacrificing computational resources during training because both use distinct learning algorithms suited to specific types of problems.\n\n3. Autoencoder with Restricted Boltzmann Machine: By combining unsupervised feature extraction aspects like dimensionality reduction via autoencoders along with supervised techniques used by deep learning models like Restricted Boltzmann Machines, this creates an even stronger foundation upon which effective predictions could be made given certain datasets.\n\nOverall, the main goal when developing any type-agnostic AI solution should always focus on optimizing predictive power while also keeping long-term scalability"
