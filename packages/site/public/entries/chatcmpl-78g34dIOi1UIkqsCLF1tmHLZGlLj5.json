Hang a large calendar on the wall where you mark important dates like birthdays or appointments while involving your child in the process.\n\n3. Set goals together: Encourage setting short-term and long-term goals (academic or personal interests) with deadlines attached to them; this helps children recognize how planning ahead aids success.\n\n4. Prioritize tasks: Teach children about prioritizing by listing things that need attention within a day or week then ranking them accordingly regarding importance/urgency levels – ‘urgent’, ‘important’ & ‘extras’.\n\n5.Promote productivity during peak times: Help them identify their most efficient working hours - e.g., focusing on schoolwork post-breakfast rather than late evenings when concentration wanes off more quickly.\n\n6.Create a balance between work and leisure time along with creating schedules – Ensure adequate downtime alongside the activity-filled day by setting aside moments dedicated purely towards relaxation/family bonding etc.; preventing burnout becomes key here!\n\n7.Make chores more interactive- Turn tidying up into games/timelimited challenges wherein there’s reward-based motivation upon successful completion; it may help making mundane tasks enjoyable\"\n\n8.Teach effective list-making techniques such as To-do lists where they cross off items as per priority so they gauge satisfaction having"
