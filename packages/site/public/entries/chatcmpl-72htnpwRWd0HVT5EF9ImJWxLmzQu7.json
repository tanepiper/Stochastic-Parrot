Revolutionaries and thinkers during the Enlightenment: The decline of absolute monarchy can be attributed to various key events and figures during the late 18th century, particularly during the Age of Enlightenment. Philosophers such as John Locke, Voltaire, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau put forth ideas that questioned traditional authority structures like absolute monarchy and paved the way for more democratic systems.\n\n2. Oliver Cromwell: While England did not fully abandon monarchy until later, Oliver Cromwell is often credited with pushing it along its path toward parliamentary democracy. In 1649, he helped bring about King Charles I's execution following their defeat in English Civil War, established republicanism (in which sovereignty resides with citizens) as an alternative form of government through his time as Lord Protector from 1653-58.\n\n3.
