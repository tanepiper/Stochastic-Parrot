File a police report: Immediately report the loss of your ID card or driver's license to local law enforcement. A police report is helpful in case someone tries to use your identification fraudulently.\n\n2. Place a fraud alert on credit reports: Contact one of the three main credit reporting agencies (Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion) and request that they place a 90-day fraud alert on your account. This requires creditors and lenders to verify your identity before opening any accounts in your name.\n\n3. Cancel or replace other lost cards/documents: If you have lost other documents/cards along with your ID card, be sure you cancel those as well – such as bank cards, social security cards, etc., whatever might have been stolen together with the main identification document.\n\n4. Check financial statements for unauthorized activity: Regularly monitor statements from all financial institutions connected to sensitive information like credit cards or bank accounts regularly after losing an identification document.\n\n5.Register with Identity Theft Protection services (optional): Enroll in an identity theft protection service for ongoing monitoring and alerts concerning suspicious activity related to personal information like Social Security numbers\n\n6.Apply for replacement IDs:\n\n- For government-issued IDs such as a driver’s license or state identification card - visit respective departments responsible like Motor Vehicles Departments\n-Remember; extra documentation will probably need verifying identity during application processes : documents like birth certificate/passports/utility bills/citizenship certificates/etc.,\n-Replacement fees may be applicable when duplicating these types of government registry files/acknowledgment paper identifications"
