Invest in high-quality bedding materials: This includes sheets made from Egyptian or Supima cotton with a thread count of at least 300, a luxurious down comforter or duvet, and plush pillows filled with feathers or memory foam.\n\n2. Start with a clean and comfortable mattress: Make sure your mattress is well-supported and that you have added any necessary padding, such as a mattress pad or mattress topper for extra comfort.\n\n3. Layer the bottom sheet: If using flat sheets, place it over the bed so that it hangs evenly on both sides. Tuck it under the foot end first then beneath each side of the mattress\n\n4. Place the top sheet face-down over the fitted sheet (the decorative edge should be toward the headboard). Position it about six inches below the headboard; this will allow room to fold back later when making up the rest of your royal sleeping quarters.\n\n5.Use hospital corners when tucking in your top sheet.
