Economic contributor: Tourism is a significant source of revenue, employment and foreign exchange earnings for the country. In 2019, tourism contributed about 4% to Singapore's GDP and generated over 152 billion Singapore dollars in total visitor receipts.\n\n2. Job creation: The tourism industry provides direct and indirect employment opportunities across various sectors such as hospitality, food and beverage, retail, travel services, attractions, cruise centers and event organizations.\n\n3. Infrastructure development: To accommodate tourists' needs, the government invests heavily in infrastructure projects like transport networks (roadways), airport expansions (i.e., Changi Airport Terminal expansion) or new attractions like Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort & Gardens by the Bay which often yields multiplier benefits on other industries too.\n\n4. Global reputation-building: As a small nation-state with limited natural resources , tourism plays a crucial role in promoting its soft power internationally through cultural diplomacy efforts showcasing diverse heritage offerings such as museums or art galleries displaying colonial past connections between East & West cultures e.g., Asian Civilisations Museum etcetera.\n\n5. Urban planning & regeneration efforts- Tourist precincts including Chinatown must be maintained regularly keeping areas clean while retaining their authentic essence so visitors can experience local ambience firsthand during visits; this translates into creating vibrant liveable neighborhoods that residents themselves appreciate additionally benefitting them economically through increased commercial activity owing higher tourist footfall aside benefiting regular socio-cultural exchanges where different ethnic communities interact with one another dissipating community tensions ultimately promoting racial harmony cohesion overall i.e 'Tourist effect' indirectly encourages social integration outcomes among various communities boosting inter-racial understanding tolerance domestically thereby contributing towards broader state objectives pertaining successful cohesive multicultural society aspirations"
