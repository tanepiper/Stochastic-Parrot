If the input data contains biases that reflect stereotypes, historical discrimination or other societal biases present in society or human behavior, then it may lead to unintended consequences when an AI system learns from this data and makes predictions based on these patterns. Efforts are being made by researchers and developers to minimize and mitigate bias in AI systems through better recognition of potential sources of bias and taking measures during development/design stages to counteract them."
