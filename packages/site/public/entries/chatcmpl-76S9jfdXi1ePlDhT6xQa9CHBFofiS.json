Educational background: A person who has attended school or received a higher education is more likely to be exposed to diverse reading materials and therefore develop good reading habits.\n\n2. Socioeconomic status: Access to books and other reading materials can vary depending on one's financial situation, with those from a higher socioeconomic status often having greater access to resources.\n\n3. Family upbringing: If an individual grows up in a household where there is an emphasis on the importance of reading, they are more likely to develop good reading habits themselves.\n\n4. Interest and motivation: Some people may naturally have a passion for learning through literature, which will influence their tendency towards regular reading.\n\n5.
