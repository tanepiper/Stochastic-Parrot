Я тебя люблю (Ya tebya lyublyu) - This is a classic, straightforward way to say \"I love you,\" suitable for romantic relationships.\n\n2. Ты мне нравишься (Ty mne nravish'sya) - This phrase translates more closely to \"I like you\" or \"You please me.\" It would be appropriate for expressing affection at the beginning stages of a relationship or when referring to a friendly attraction.\n\n3. Меня к тебе тянет (Menya k tebe tyánet) - Literally meaning “I’m drawn to you,” this expression also implies a powerful emotional connection between people that goes beyond simple infatuation.\n\n4. Моё сердце принадлежит тебе (Moyo serdce prinadlezhit tebe)- This phrase means \"My heart belongs to you,\" emphasizing your dedication and commitment to someone.\n\n5. Любимая / Любимый (Lyúbimaya/Lyúbimyj) – Referring respectively as darling, these endearments can be used informally among friends, family members, and couples who have been together for some time but still feel very attached emotionally.\n\n6 .
