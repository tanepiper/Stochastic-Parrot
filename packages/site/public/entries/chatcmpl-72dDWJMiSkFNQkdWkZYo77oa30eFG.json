It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. The game is known for its colorful graphics, fast-paced gameplay, and creative building mechanics."
