However, I can help you understand how to use web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup in Python.\n\nBeautifulSoup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees from the HTML and XML files that can be used to extract data easily.\n\nFirstly, make sure you have installed the necessary libraries: BeautifulSoup4 and requests:\nOpen your terminal (Command Prompt) then type:\n\n```bash\npip install beautifulsoup4\npip install requests\n```\nThen import these two libraries with following code:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup as BSoup\nimport requests\n\nreq = requests.get('http://books.toscrape.com/')\nsoup = BSoup(req.text,'html.parser')\nprint(soup.prettify())\n```\n\nThis will get raw html of 'http://books.toscrape.com/' site using request.get() function pass its content req.text in parsed tree form through soup variable by passing tags we got whole document's prettified format using .prettify()\n\nTo Extract specific details or links:\nIf you know the tag name being used e.g., 'h3' :\n\n``` python \ntitles=[]\nfor book_title in soup.select('h3'):\n    titles.append(book_title['title'])\n print(titles)\n ```\nPlease adjust according to desired page"
