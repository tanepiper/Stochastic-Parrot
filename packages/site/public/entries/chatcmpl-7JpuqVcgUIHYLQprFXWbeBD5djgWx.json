Excessive workload: Working long hours without enough breaks or time off can lead to exhaustion and a lack of motivation.\n\n2. Insufficient control: If employees don't have the autonomy to make decisions related to their work, it may cause frustration and dissatisfaction leading to burnout.\n\n3. Poor management: A poor manager who lacks support, recognition, or encouragement for employees' efforts increases stress levels often resulting in job burnout.\n\n4. Difficult workplace relationships: Strained relationships with colleagues or supervisors due to conflicts or miscommunication negatively affect mental well-being and increase the risk of job burn out.\n\n5. Workplace bullying or harassment: Continuous negative behavior from coworkers, such as verbal abuse or gossiping about one another creates a hostile work environment contributing greatly towards job burnout.\n\n6. Lack of role clarity: When an employee's responsibilities aren't clearly defined or they receive conflicting messages about expectations at work can lead them feeling overwhelmed and disoriented leading them towards burning out quickly under pressure.\n\n7.
