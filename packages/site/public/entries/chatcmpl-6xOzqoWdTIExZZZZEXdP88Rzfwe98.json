For example: \"move pawn from e2 to e4\" or simply use this notation: \"e2 e4\".\n\nRemember that there are 8 ranks (rows) labeled as numbers (1-8), and 8 files (columns) labeled as letters (a-h). When moving a piece, always indicate the file letter followed by the rank number.\n\nHere is an overview of all pieces:\n\n- King (K): one per player\n- Queen (Q): one per player\n- Rook (R): two per player\n- Bishop(B): two per player\n- Knight(N/Kt):: two per player\n- Pawn(P/Pawn):: eight per player\n\nThe starting position in a standard game should look like this:\n\nWhite:\nPawn - Pawns on each square of row/rank 2.\nKnight - One knight on b1, another on g1.\nBishop - One bishop on c1, another on f1.\nRook - One rook at a1 and h9 \nQueen - The white queen goes on d1.\nKing - The king goes next to it at e1 \n\nBlack :: same but opposite. Starting from eighth rank towards down. pawns @ seventh rank.\n\nNow it's your turn! Please type your move using either regular English text or chess notation format :)"
