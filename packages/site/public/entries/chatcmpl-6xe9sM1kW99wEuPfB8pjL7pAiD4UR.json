Early Childhood Education - This stage covers children up to six years old where they attend nurseries or pre-schools.\n\n2. Elementary School (Ensino Fundamental) – This level includes primary education from grade 1 to grade 5 for children ages 6-10, as well as lower secondary school from grades 6 through 9 for kids aged between 11-14.\n\n3. High School (Ensino Médio) – After completion of elementary school, students proceed with high school. It lasts three years, typically covering ages between 15 -17.\n\n4.
