High amounts of cortisol circulating in our bodies for extended periods weaken numerous physical systems, including the lymphatic system.\n\n2. Inflammation: Another way stress impacts the immune system is by promoting inflammation through stimulating pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines. Chronic low-level inflammation has been linked to various diseases, such as heart disease and autoimmune disorders.\n\n3.
