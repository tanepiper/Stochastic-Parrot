Most strokes affect people over 65 years old.\n\n2. Gender: Men have a higher risk of having a stroke than women. However, women are more likely to die from a stroke.\n\n3. Heredity and race: People with a family history of stroke have an increased risk of experiencing one themselves, particularly if there is genetic predisposition towards certain conditions that contribute to the development of strokes like high blood pressure, diabetes or heart disease.\n\n4. Personal or medical history: Individuals who have had strokes in the past face higher risks for subsequent ones; likewise, anyone with other cardiovascular conditions (coronary artery disease), diabetes or transient ischemic attacks (“mini-strokes”) may be at heightened vulnerability for critical problems later on down the line.\n\n5. Smoking and tobacco use: Smokers face up to double their likelihoods when compared alongside non-smokers - this includes cigarettes as well! In addition nicotine usage greatly worsens overall vascular health leading ultimately into coronary artery blockages which could result disastrously depending upon circumstances present within individual users' lives\n\n6 .
