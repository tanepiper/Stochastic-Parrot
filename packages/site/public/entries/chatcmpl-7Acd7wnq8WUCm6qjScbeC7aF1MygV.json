Goku - Dragon Ball series (due to his capability to transform into multiple forms, each one more powerful than the former)\n2. Saitama - One Punch Man (considered unbeatable due to being able to defeat enemies with a single punch)\n3. Naruto Uzumaki - Naruto and Naruto Shippuden series (gifted with immense chakra reserves and a wide array of abilities)\n4. Ichigo Kurosaki - Bleach (possessing incredible power growth throughout the series)\n5. Monkey D Luffy - One Piece (his constant training leads him closer to perfection in terms of combat ability)\n\nNote that each fan's opinion on who is deemed the most powerful or strong will differ depending on their personal preference for different types of abilities or feats characters have accomplished in their respective universes."
