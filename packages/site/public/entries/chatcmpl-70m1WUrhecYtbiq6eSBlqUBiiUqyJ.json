This amount of energy will support healthy growth and development while maintaining an appropriate weight. The calorie content should primarily come from a balanced diet consisting of carbohydrates (at least half from whole grains), proteins (including lean meats, fish, legumes), healthy fats, fruits and vegetables as well as dairy products or equivalent non-dairy sources.\n\nRegular exercise is also necessary for overall health improvement since it will help manage the muscular system's needs after consuming that many calories. Additionally- make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated!"
