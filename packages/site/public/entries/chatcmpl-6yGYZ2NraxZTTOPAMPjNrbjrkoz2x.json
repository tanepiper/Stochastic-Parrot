They can perform millions or even billions of calculations per second.\n\n2. Accuracy: Computers are less prone to error than humans and consistently deliver accurate results when provided with correct input data.\n\n3. Storage Capability: Modern computers can store vast quantities of information in a small space, allowing for easy access and retrieval.\n\n4. Automation: Computers can be programmed to carry out complex tasks automatically, without any human intervention required after the initial setup phase.\n\n5. Consistency & Reliability: Once programmed, computers will always perform the same task in exactly the same way until told otherwise – they do not experience fatigue or get bored like humans do.\n\n6. Versatility: With different types software and hardware available, a single computer is able to complete an extensive range of tasks across various industries—from accounting to video game design—making them extremely versatile machines.\n\n7. Programmability: The ability to write code that allows you manipulate how your computer works makes it adaptable for numerous purposes with new possibilities continuously emerging as programming languages evolve over time\n\n8. Connectivity & Communication Capabilities– Thanks largely due improvements both internet networking technology since late 20th century onward; there hardly seems exist limit what connected capable communicate other devices or online services around world instantaneously!\n\n9.Multitasking - Most modern computers have multitasking capabilities which enable users execute multiple processes simultaneously helping improve productivity reduce downtime between completing individual sets operations/tasks etcetera involved given project hence increased efficiency output overall result/reward saving valuable resources (time money system energy) during ongoing__computational activity__\n\n10.Graphical User Interface(GUI)- GUIs allow ordinary people interact without needing type lengthy series characters"
