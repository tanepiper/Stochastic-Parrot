This involves working with both homogeneous (single-phase) systems like solutions or gas mixtures and heterogeneous (multiphase) systems such as suspensions, slurries, or emulsions.\n\nIn chemistry research at universities or research institutes may include developing new synthetic routes to create novel molecules for pharmaceuticals industry; studying catalysis to improve reaction rates; investigating surface materials for nano-technology applications like sensors; exploring green methods reducing waste created during reactions etcetera . On-application work could involve characterizing synthesized product x-ray diffraction techniques confirming molecular structure single crystal analysis crystallography tools understanding how different factors affect overall yield optimize conditions accordingly making sure all impurities are removed producing final & others too numerous list here .\n\nChemical Engineers often play major roles operating settings plants paper mills ensuring operations remain safe meet environmental standards compliance government regulations optimizing operating costs retaining high quality productions trouble-shooting problems arise site maintaining steady flow raw material products formulating plans reduce any potential shut downs providing back-up support colleagues assisting starting up plant turn-key basis sharing know-how fellow workers less experienced ones administrative duties  prioritizing tasks addressing urgent issues troubleshooting providing technical direction developing project schedules coordinating parallel efforts minimizing downtime ensuring smooth ongoing operation\n\nThere's overlap in responsibilities between professionals but they have distinct focuses"
