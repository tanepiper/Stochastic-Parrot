Enuresis alarms work by emitting a sound, vibration or both when the sensor detects moisture, and helps condition the child's brain to recognize the sensation of bladder fullness while asleep.\n\nSome of the benefits include:\n\n1. Faster results: Studies have shown that enuresis alarms can lead to quicker resolution of bed-wetting problems compared to other treatment methods like medication and behavioural therapy.\n\n2. Long-lasting improvement: Using an alarm can lead to improved long-term success as it actively teaches children how their body feels just before urination so they can wake up and go to the bathroom.\n\n3. Non-invasive method: Unlike medications with potential side effects, enuresis alarms provide a safe approach without using drugs or chemicals on their bodies.\n\n4. Increased self-esteem and confidence: As children experience more dry nights due-to-use of these devices-may ultimately-lead increased feelings-of-confidence+and%self-esteem as well>.\n\n5./Cost-effective:-Though_initially might be-experiencing higher-costs-than_motorvehicles/th/gener_medicine/long_run;less money may_needed due-fewer_diapers/bed_sheets/clean_laundry._These savings+might potentially offset-initial investment_down;line+="
