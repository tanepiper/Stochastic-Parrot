Short-term effects include respiratory symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, eye irritation, headache, dizziness and fatigue. In some cases, people may also experience chest tightness or throat irritation.\n\nLong-term exposure to poor air quality can result in more serious consequences including lung diseases such as bronchitis or emphysema; heart problems like arrhythmias and congestive heart failure; neurological issues including cognitive decline; reproductive complications like preterm births and low birth weight for babies; cancer of the lungs or other organs; liver damage leading to cirrhosis or even death due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations.\n\nIn addition to physical health impacts of poor air quality there are also mental health aspects which have been linked with higher anxiety levels depression increased aggression reduced ability concentrate learn emerging research suggests that it may contribute developmental disorders ADHD autism spectrum disorder children growing up regions severely polluted environments at greater risk experiencing these negative outcomes than those better-resourced cleaner areas overall impact not just individual but communities whole government policies strategies need aimed improving state's environmental conditions safeguard its citizens wellbeing future generations.=\"\">\n\nSome specific groups of people are especially vulnerable to the negative health impacts of poor air quality. These at-risk populations include:\n\n1. Children: Their developing lungs make them particularly susceptible.\n2. Older adults: Those above 60 years often have weaker immune systems making them less capable in resisting infection.\n3. Pregnant women: Excessive exposure could potentially harm unborn babies during development.\n4. People with pre-existing lung diseases (such as asthma)_: Their vulnerabilities additionally increase when exposed"
