Acknowledge their feelings: \"I understand that trust is important and I'm sorry if my actions have led you to feel this way.\"\n\n2. Ask for reasons: \"Can you help me understand what has caused your lack of trust in me? I'd like the opportunity to address those concerns if possible.\"\n\n3. Offer reassurance and a plan to rebuild trust: \"It's important to me that we work on rebuilding your trust in our relationship/friendship, so please let me know how I can do that.\"\n\n4. Own up to any mistakes or wrongdoings: If there was an incident that damaged their faith in you, take responsibility for it and apologize sincerely.\n\n5. Show empathy and patience: Understand that building or regaining somebody's trust may take time, be patient with them while working towards earning back their confidence.\n\n6. Express your own feelings (if appropriate): Share how the lack of trust affects you - this may make them more comfortable addressing why they struggle with trusting.\n\n7.Be open about improvements/changes you're making (in case relevant) : Talk calmly and openly about the positive changes or efforts being made by yourself aiming at improving their overall perception when it comes up again between both parties involved . This helps show genuine commitment within relationships where mistrust exists due harsh circumstances before"
