        "content": "In general, there are three primary approaches to measuring the economy of a country: output measures such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), income measures such as Gross National Income (GNI), and expenditure measures including consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. \n\n1. Output measure - Gross Domestic Product (GDP): GDP is the most commonly used indicator for assessing a nation's economy. It calculates the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific time period, usually annually or quarterly. This method considers production from industries like agriculture, manufacturing, mining, construction and services.\n\n2. Income measure - Gross National Income (GNI): GNI is another metric used to analyze an economy's performance by looking at its total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents during specified periods like quarters or years. It includes wages earned by citizens working abroad as well as overseas investments but excludes foreign workers' earnings within the country in question.\n\n3. Expenditure approach: As per this measurement system’s components -- consumption + investment + government spending + (exports-imports) – it collectively illustrates how money flows in various sectors inside an economic structure can be traced both privately among individual consumers/businesses/entities via private expenditures on products/goods/services alongside public sector allotments pertaining mainly to grants/subsidies allocated toward infrastructure/healthcare/welfare purposes/etc.; overall illustrating prevailing fiscal patterns affecting national trends vis-a-vis international capitals/markets/trading partners operating accordingly alongside relative financial stability levels sustained across respective global territories competing together amidst world relations.\n\nThese methods provide different perspectives when comparing countries since they account for distinct factors occurring over changing timelines respectively being recalled according key benchmarks gauged en masse domestically/internationally/simultaneously"
