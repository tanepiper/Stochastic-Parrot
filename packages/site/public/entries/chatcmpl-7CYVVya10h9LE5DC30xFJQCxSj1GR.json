        "content": "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with one methane molecule being about 25-28 times more effective at trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere than one carbon dioxide molecule. This makes it especially harmful to the environment when emitted into the atmosphere.\n\nThe main source of methane is from human activities such as agriculture, fossil fuel extraction, and waste management. Agriculture accounts for almost half of global methane emissions, mainly due to enteric fermentation – a digestive process in ruminant animals like cows, sheep and goats that produces methane as part of their normal digestion – and manure decomposition.\n\nAnother major source comes from oil and natural gas production. When these resources are extracted from the ground or transported through pipelines, some amount of unburned methane can escape into the atmosphere directly (known as fugitive emissions). Methane can also leak unintentionally from improperly sealed mines or wells during drilling operations.\n\nWaste management contributes significant amounts of methane when organic materials like food waste decomposes anaerobically (without oxygen) in landfills or large piles. Millions of tons produce each year through this process alone.\n\nBesides its contributions to climate change by worsening global warming effects, high concentrations air can be hazardous to humans health considering it flammable toxic under certain conditions increasing risk accidents involving explosions fires where accumulations occur confined spaces near emitting sources.\n\nTherefore reducing emitting procedures developing alternatives could greatly mitigate potential outcomes on changing climates while improving overall public safety simultaneously taking steps towards sustainable living practices within various industries sectors responsible substantial releases harmful substances including most notably mentioned earlier agricultural livestock energy generation processes amongst others institutions importance cannot overstated given current state environmental trends already observable consequences persistent buildup potentially devastating gases earths ecosystem moreover concerted efforts required governmental bodies international organizations private corporations individuals alike order implement solutions required transform"
