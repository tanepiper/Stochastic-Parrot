Online friendships, just like any other form of friendship, can offer emotional and social support while also allowing people from all walks of life to connect with one another.\n\nThere are several reasons why people should support or encourage others in forming online friendships:\n\n1. Accessibility: Online platforms allow individuals that may have difficulty forming connections in person due to factors such as physical disabilities, mental health conditions or even location barriers (like living in remote areas) to make friends easily and without boundaries.\n\n2. Shared interests: The internet provides a space for those with niche hobbies or passions, which might be difficult to find within their physical community, to meet like-minded individuals who share the same interests.\n\n3. Diversity: Through online interactions and friendships, individuals are exposed to different cultures and perspectives around the world that they otherwise would not have access too â€“ helping promote global understanding and empathy.\n\n4. Emotional support: It can be easier for some people to express their feelings through written words rather than verbally; having an online friend serves as an outlet for these emotions providing comfort during tough times.\n\n5. Safe spaces: For people who prefer anonymity at times when discussing personal matters- be it due to privacy concerns or wanting unbiased advice - an anonymous conversation with someone you trust could resolve unpleasant issues without revealing your identity.\n\nOverall, fostering strong virtual relationships has become increasingly crucial during this modern era marked by rapid technological advances; instead of viewing them as substitutes for traditional face-to-face ones we should appreciate each format equally empowering us all towards a connected future embracing human interdependence wherever found.\n\n\n\n\n"
