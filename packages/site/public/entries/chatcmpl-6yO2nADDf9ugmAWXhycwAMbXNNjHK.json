        "content": "The formation of the Earth, along with the other planets in our Solar System, began around 4.6 billion years ago. It started from a giant cloud of gas and dust known as a solar nebula. This nebula began to collapse under its own gravity, causing it to spin and flatten into a disk shape.\n\nWithin this disk of material, tiny particles clumped together due to electrostatic attraction and formed larger particles called planetesimals. Over time, these planetesimals collided with each other and merged through gravitational force, gradually building up larger bodies that eventually became protoplanets.\n\nThe early Earth was hot and likely molten due to multiple factors such as the energy generated by in-falling debris during its formation process and heat produced from radioactive decay of certain elements within its core.\n\nAs millions of years passed, the outer layer cooled down enough to form a thin crust while heavier elements sank towards Earth's center forming layers like mantle & core. The lighter elements rose up towards surface thus differentiating inner structure into three main parts - crust (outermost), mantle (middle), core (innermost).\n\nThen around 4 billion years ago when early Earth was still being bombarded heavily by leftover space debris including asteroids & meteorites etc., a big celestial-object possibly Mars-sized is thought to have crashed into the young planet causing massive upheaval & huge chunks were ejected back out which ultimately coalesced under their own gravity forming our current moon nearby earth!\n\nFurthermore then over billions of more years some major events constantly shaped evolution =&gt; Those include continuous volcanic activity enriching atmosphere adding various gases like water vapor CO2 nitrogen ammonia methane; Cooling further consolidate oceans seas lakes rivers continents habitable landmasses plus plate tectonics reshaped ge"
