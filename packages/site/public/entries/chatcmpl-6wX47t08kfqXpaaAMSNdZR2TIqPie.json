The goal of setting boundaries is to protect yourself emotionally, physically, and mentally from behaviors that may negatively impact your life.\n\nHere are some tips for setting healthy boundaries:\n\n1. Know your limits: Understand what makes you feel uncomfortable or mistreated. Be aware of your emotional, physical, and mental needs so that you know when someone crosses a line.\n\n2. Communicate clearly: Express yourself clearly and calmly without anger or blame when discussing boundary issues with others. Be specific about the changes required to respect these limits better.\n\n3. Practice assertiveness: It's essential to express expectations firmly but respectfully while maintaining eye contact, using \"I\" statements (e.g., \"I feel disrespected when…\").\n\n4. Stay consistent: Maintain consistency by sticking to established rules continuously; otherwise, people may get confused about where they stand with you.\n\n5- Learn to say 'no': Remember that saying 'no' doesn't make you selfish - it makes sure that both parties have reasonable expectations from each other during interactions.\n\n6- Prioritize self-care: Set aside time for restorative activities like hobbies or exercise regularly – this will help develop a greater appreciation of one's intrinsic value separate from external approval/acceptance gained through compliance towards surrounding demands/\n\n7- Tune into feelings/emotions associated within personal space violations & cues provided by intuition/.
