This could lead to early detection and intervention of mental illnesses.\n\n2. Personalized treatment plans: By analyzing data from various sources like wearable devices or even social media behavior, AI systems could help clinicians tailor more effective treatment plans for individual patients' unique needs.\n\n3.
