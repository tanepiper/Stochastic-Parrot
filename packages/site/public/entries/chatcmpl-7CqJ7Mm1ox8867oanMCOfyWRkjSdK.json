Be genuinely interested in others: Show genuine interest in the people you interact with by asking questions about their lives, hobbies, or interests.\n\n2. Smile and maintain eye contact: This helps create a positive energy around you that can make people feel comfortable and at ease when conversating with you.\n\n3. Listen actively: When someone is speaking, give them your full attention and avoid interrupting them or looking away while they're talking.\n\n4. Confident body language: Stand tall, take up space, use engaging gestures while talking, but remain natural- as it projects self-assurance which can be very attractive to others.\n\n5. Give compliments sincerely without expecting anything in return: Complimenting someone on their appearance or character traits should come from an honest place without any ulterior motives attached to it.\n\n6. Be empathetic toward other's emotions or situations – be kind: Demonstrating compassion demonstrates that we understand another person's feelings/situation based on our own experience of similar circumstances\n\n7  Practice good manners - such as holding doors open for others, saying please/thank you/you’re welcome-come across polite/respectful to others makes these individuals seem friendlier likeable overall"
