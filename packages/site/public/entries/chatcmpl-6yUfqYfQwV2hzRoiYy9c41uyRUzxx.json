Habitats have different requirements for the species that inhabit them, and various biomes support diverse ecosystems with unique characteristics.\n\nHowever, to understand how biomes change over time, one can consider factors such as:\n\n1) Climate change: Shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns can cause a biome's boundaries to expand or contract. This may force certain plant and animal species out of their original habitats.\n\n2) Human activity: Deforestation, agricultural expansion, urbanization, and pollution affect habitat quality within a biome by altering local ecosystem conditions.\n\n3) Natural disasters: Events like wildfires, floods, or volcanic eruptions can significantly alter the physical structure of natural landscapes.\n\n4) Biological interactions: Competition between various plant and animal species for resources influences how successful they will be in maintaining populations within their preferred habitat types.\n\n5) Invasive species: Plants or animals introduced from other parts of the world can upset delicate ecological balances among native organisms if they compete better for scarce resources or overwhelm predator defenses. This disrupts ecosystem dynamics within affected biomes' habitats`.\n\nThese factors often interact with one another to produce synergistic effects influencing habitat quality across an entire range of interconnected regions`"
