However, we can provide some insights into how these types of wildfires differ.\n\n1. Causes: Human-made fires are mainly caused by deforestation activities where humans intentionally set fire to clear land for agriculture or other purposes, while natural forest fires occur due to lightning strikes or other environmental causes.\n\n2. Scale: The scale of human-made fires like the Amazon rainforest ones depends on the extent of deforestation taking place. In contrast, natural forest fires usually have variable scales depending upon weather conditions, fuel load (availability of flammable material), and topography.\n\n3. Frequency: Human-made fires tend to be more frequent than natural ones because they are driven by human activity that constantly takes place for domestic consumption and export markets demands.\n\n4. Long-term impact: While both types cause severe ecological damage initially, there may be differences in long-term impacts if large areas experience successive years being exposed similar events it will struggle heavily recovering its old composure; this might lead further species loss erosion increasing carbon emissions over time which higher then naturally occurring events would have had provided forests adequate recuperation periods between them a balance is maintained ecosystem resilience preserved - especially when considering proper intervention mitigation efforts put into practice individuals concerned authorities alike respond appropriately controlling managing situation hand effectively ensuring least possible harm done circumstances allow--\n\nIn conclusion comparing sizes frequencies too direct manner slightly misleading giving individual circumstances behind occurrence certain event say less about overall contributing factors determine domain under discussion therefore important recognize relevance context hence examining relationships permit fair assessment area's susceptibility vulnerability potential future threats posed external agents who plan control"
