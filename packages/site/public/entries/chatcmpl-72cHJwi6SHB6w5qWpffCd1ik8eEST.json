This can help potential buyers know if there are any issues associated with the property before they purchase it.\n\nSome of the key components included in a land title search may include:\n\n1. Property description: The legal description of the property's precise location, boundaries, and measurements.\n\n2. Names of previous owners: A chronological list of all individuals who have previously owned the property.\n\n3. Liens and encumbrances: Any financial claims against the property (e.g., mortgages) must be listed in order to provide information about outstanding debts or other issues potentially affecting ownership.\n\n4. Easements and restrictions: Details on how others may legally use portions of your land (e.g., utility companies) or limitations to development rights for protection purposes such as conservation areas.\n\n5. Tax status: Information on whether all taxes related to the property have been paid up-to-date by current owner(s).\n\n6  Legal disputes and judgments - Evidence either pending lawsuits involving claimed rights over part/all parcel interests/options vested among litigants wherein verdicts reached after adjudication hold bearing upon prospective purchasers intending investments; likewise public notice directives resulting from contentious negotiations aimed towards reconciliation between adversaries seeking resolution - e.g., divorces settlements challenging each partyâ€™s claim over portion deemed rightfully theirs; debts initiated by creditors presupposing promissory notes originally instigated via demand-type transactions subsequently collapsed/failures/transfers absorbed future expenses eventually tendered unaccountable actions undertaken stemming acquired relationships hitherto binding respective parties hereto indebted thereof consequences attending untoward monetary obligations burdening collateral assets accordingly encumbered transfers"
