        "content": "There are a few reasons your iPhone may not be playing videos:\n\n1. Network or connectivity issues: If you're trying to stream a video from the internet or an app, poor signal strength or Wi-Fi connection can cause the video to stop working.\n\n2. Unsupported video format: The native Videos app on iPhones only supports certain file formats like MP4, M4V, and MOV. If you have other formats like AVI, MKV, etc., download a third-party app (e.g., VLC Media Player) that supports various video formats.\n\n3. Outdated software: Update your iOS if needed since outdated software versions could cause compatibility issues with some videos and apps.\n\n4. Corrupted files or storage space issues: If the video doesn't play directly from your phone storage, there might be corruption in the file itself; re-importing it might solve this issue. Additionally, ensure that there is enough free space on your device for smooth playback of larger files.\n\n5. Restarting may help rule out temporary glitches related to running processes on your device; reboot helps clear unnecessary processes from memory which allows proper function of applications.\n\n6.Update Apps- Sometimes updating social media network apps like YouTube can lead fixed playback errors further ensuring no bugs are causing blockage\n\n7.Restrict Background App Refresh- By restricting background refreshes,this will free up processing power now available for current application as opposed to it being wasted refreshing apps concurrently\n\nIf none of these methods work and consistently cannot access any online concerts regardless of platform used consider contacting Apple support seek advice possibly repairs if necessary"
