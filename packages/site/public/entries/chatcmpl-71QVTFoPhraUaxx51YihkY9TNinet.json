If you are asking me how to prove \"n!\" or \"n factorial\" increases as the value of n (integer) increases: \n\nIn this case, we can easily show that it is true using induction.\n\nBase case: For n=1, 1! = 1\nInductive step: Assume that for some integer k > 0,\n    k! <= (k+1)!.\nNow let us consider ((k+1)+1)! which equals (k+2)!\n(k+2)! = (k + 2)(k + 1) * .... *3*2*11!,\nwhich clearly shows an increase in value since each term now has an additional (k+2).\n\nThus by the principle of mathematical induction, n! will be greater than or equal to any other smaller factorial.\n\n2. If you are asking about showing real-life examples regarding growth factors like population growth or compound interest:\n\nIn real life scenarios like population growth and finance-related terms where compounding is involved, the rate at which things grow depicts that as they progress with time their worth/value increases exponentially.\n\nFor example:\ni. Population Growth - As humans reproduce more offspring and these offspring themselves grow and reproduce over time; this results in exponential population growth.\nii. Compound Interest - In finance, when an amount accrues interest periodically rather than once at the end of its tenure; it leads to faster returns created due to investing early on in comparison to simple annual interest formats causing money's future value based on principal invested today increasing thus making investments worthwhile.\n\nThese examples demonstrate a consistent growth pattern where worth/causes/effects were magnified with time leading to accumulating"
