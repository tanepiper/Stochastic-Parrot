It is an intergovernmental military alliance between 30 European and North American countries, established on April 4, 1949. The organization implements the North Atlantic Treaty that was signed on April 4, 1949.\n\nThe main purpose of NATO is to provide collective security and defense against potential threats from non-member states or organizations, by upholding its members' commitment to support each other in case of attack as stipulated by Article 5 of the treaty. This includes shared defense planning, joint exercises and training programs, and overall coordination on matters related to international security.\n\nNATO also plays various roles in crisis management such as peacekeeping missions and humanitarian aid during disasters or emergencies. Furthermore, it promotes political consultation among member states regarding issues related to global security; participating countries frequently coordinate their policies towards external crises through dialogue within NATO fora."
