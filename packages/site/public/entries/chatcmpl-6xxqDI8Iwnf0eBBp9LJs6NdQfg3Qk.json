Here are a few ways of achieving better health in elderly people:\n\n1. Encourage regular exercise: Physical activity helps maintain muscle strength, flexibility, balance, and mobility among elderly people. It could include walking, swimming, yoga or group exercise classes tailored for seniors.\n\n2. Nutrient-dense diet: Older adults should eat diverse and healthy foods like fruits and vegetables that provide essential vitamins and minerals as well as adequate protein for maintaining muscle mass.\n\n3. Stay mentally active: Stimulating cognitive activities such as reading books or newspapers, doing crossword puzzles or Sudoku can help keep the mind sharp.\n\n4. Social interactions: Building strong social connections through frequent conversations with friends, family members or participation in community groups is vital for emotional wellbeing in old age.\n\n5. Regular medical check-ups: Encouraging routine visits to healthcare providers ensures early detection of potential issues like diabetes or hypertension so they can be managed effectively before they become larger problems.\n\n6.Assistive devices when needed: Using supportive tools such as hearing aids, eyeglasses or walkers allows older individuals greater independence while safeguarding against falls-related injuries during daily tasks.\n \n7.Maintain good oral hygiene by brushing teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste \n\n8.Create an accessible home environment that is safe using handrails on stairs; grab bars at the toilet \n\n9.Get vaccinated yearly against seasonal flu which  reduce potentially harmful disease exposure\n\n10.Restrict alcohol consumption & abstain smoking"
