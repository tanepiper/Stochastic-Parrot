Ask questions: Develop a habit of asking questions and challenging assumptions. This will force you to think more deeply about the matter at hand.\n\n2. Analyze the source: Determine if the information or argument is coming from a credible source, and learn how to identify logical fallacies or biases that may impact its validity.\n\n3. Reflect on your thought process: Evaluate the steps you took to reach a conclusion, discovering any gaps in reasoning or flaws in logic.\n\n4. Practice active listening: Give full attention when someone else is speaking, hearing their thoughts without instantly trying to impose your own opinions or ideas upon them.\n\n5.Token economy system\n\nA token economy system rewards students with tokens for target behaviors.\nTokens can often be exchanged for desired items or privileges\nToken economies have been implemented across various age groups, diagnoses, and types of setting\nCommon diagnoses included autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disabilities (ID), externalizing behavior disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 5.Enhance communication skills: Learn how to effectively present your ideas and arguments while also considering alternative viewpoints by engaging in respectful discussions with others who hold different perspectives than yourself.\n\n6.Define concepts clearly\n\nRequiring children identified which criteria were relevant when categorizing objects before giving suggestions enhanced clarity within statements being made"
