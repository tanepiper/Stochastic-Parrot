The developers utilized Python programming language, FastAPI, and GitHub to build this application and do various coding works. They faced several challenges while using these resources like browsing repositories in search for usable code snippets but overcame it by learning more about the new technology through online tutorials or asking colleagues.\n\nThe project required additional work from choosing hardware specifications such as Notebook GPU to ensuring that preview generation happens within 30 seconds so museum visitors would not have long waiting times between interactions with the exhibit.\n\nDespite overcoming all challenges associated with developing an AI-powered music system for museums, there are still some limitations linked to MuseNet toolkits like VPN setup which might be necessary if working from other countries due to geo-blocking issues experienced by developers who are based outside US borders. Additionally, poor audio quality was another issue encountered that curtailed user experience when listening intently on generated songs while visiting exhibits halls filled with background noise; they were unable however resolve said problem after acquiring higher-quality sample patches which allowed them improve overall performance greatly later down line thus enhancing guest experiences tremendously ever since then onward moving forward into future projects altogether collectively despite previously aforementioned drawbacks henceforth proving reliability efficacy indubitably justifiably emphatically resoundingly assuredly incontrovertibly.\"\"\"\n"
