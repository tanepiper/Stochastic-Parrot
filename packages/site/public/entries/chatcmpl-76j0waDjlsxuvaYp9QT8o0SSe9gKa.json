Check your credit report for errors and dispute them: Obtain a copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). Review the reports carefully, looking for any inaccuracies such as late payments or incorrect account balances. If you notice any errors, file a dispute with the respective bureau to have those items removed.\n\n2. Pay down high balances: Credit utilization plays a significant role in determining your overall credit score. Aim to reduce your balances so that they are at least 30% below their limits to improve this portion of your score.\n\n3. Make all payments on time: Your payment history accounts for around 35% of your total FICO score calculation. Ensure that you make all monthly bill payments on time – even if it's just the minimum amount due – to avoid further detrimental impacts.\n\n4. Request higher credit limits: Contact your current creditors and ask them about increasing your available balance without running a new hard inquiry on your account which will negatively impact the other aspects of constructing an improved rating by keeping lower utilization rates satisfied longer term during increased spending intervals over time\n\n5- Become an Authorized User On A Family Member's Or Friend's Account\n\n6- Negotiate For Lower Interest Rates And Better Terms With Existing Lenders\n\n7_ Maintain Some Variety Within Types Of Accounts Utilized Overall By Establishing New Primary Lines"
