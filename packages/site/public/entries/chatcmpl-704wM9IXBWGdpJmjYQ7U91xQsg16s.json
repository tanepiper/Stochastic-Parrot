Write the recipient's street address or post office box number and any apartment, suite, or unit number.\nExample: 123 Main St., Apt #4\n\n3. If applicable, write additional delivery information like rural route or suburban service:\nEg:. RR-5 \n\n4. Next is City/town or village_name+ province abbreviation(or territory) with a space followed by postal code\nEg.: Edmonton AB T6G 1K8 (postal code)\n\nThe complete format would look like this:\n\nMr. John Doe\n123 Main St., Apt #4,\nRR-5,\nEdmonton AB T6G 1K8\n\nA couple of other points to note when addressing an envelope in Canada:\n\n– After writing each line separate them by leaving enough whitespace.\n\n– It is common practice to use capital letters for all of your text.\n\n*Don't forget to include your return address in case there are issues with delivery! This can be placed at upper left corner"
