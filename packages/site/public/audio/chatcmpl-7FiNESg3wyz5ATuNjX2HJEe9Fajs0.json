To help lessen the sadness, try these suggestions:\n\n1. Stay connected: Keep in touch with your sister through phone calls, texts/chat or video calls whenever she is available.\n\n2. Share your feelings: Talk about your emotions openly with family members or close friends who understand what you're going through.\n\n3. Create new memories together: Plan trips together and look forward to creating more cherished moments when visiting each other during holidays or vacations.\n\n4. Maintain relationships in person: Reach out to other friends and relatives who can help lift your spirits when feeling down due to missing your sister.\n\n5. Focus on hobbies & interests: Engaging in activities that bring joy will help take your mind off of the distance between you two.\n\n6. Embrace change & growth: Remind yourself that life brings changes and challenges which lead to personal growth for both parties involved; this transition might enable both you and your sister opportunities for development mentally as well as emotionally.\n\nRemember time lessens the pain caused by separation, soon enough adjusting will become easier everyday just stay positive!"
