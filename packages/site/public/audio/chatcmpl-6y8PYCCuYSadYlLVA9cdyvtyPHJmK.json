A basic vegan pizza slice without any added toppings or cheese might be around 200-250 calories. However, when you add vegan cheese, various toppings like vegetables and plant-based protein sources (e.g., tofu, tempeh), or extra sauces, the calorie count can increase up to 300-400 per slice.\n\nKeep in mind that the crust type will also play a role in determining calorie countâ€”thinner-crust pizzas generally have fewer calories than thicker-crust pizzas like deep-dish or pan style. Plus, different brands of vegan cheese products may vary in terms of their nutritional content.\n\nIf you're making your own at home or looking for lower-calorie options when eating out, consider lighter portions of vegan cheese along with lots of vegetable toppings to keep overall calorie counts down while still enjoying delicious flavors."
