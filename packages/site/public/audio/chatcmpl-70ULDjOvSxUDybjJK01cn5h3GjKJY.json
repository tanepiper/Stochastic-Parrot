However, many people find the early morning to be an ideal time for meditation because it allows them to start their day with a calm and clear mind. Evening can also be a good time for meditation, as it helps unwind and relax after a busy day.\n\nUltimately, the best time for meditation is different for everyone and depends on individual preferences and schedules. The key is to establish a consistent practice that fits into one's daily routine while ensuring minimal distractions or interruptions."
