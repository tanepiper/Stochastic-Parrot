It took place between approximately 10,000-8,000 BCE and marked the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to settled farming communities. During this period, humans began to develop agriculture systematically: cultivating plants for food and domesticating animals.\n\nSome key changes during the Neolithic Revolution include:\n\n1. Settled lifestyle - People moved away from nomadic hunting and gathering groups towards establishing permanent settlements centered around farming communities.\n\n2. Agriculture - The cultivation of crops like wheat, barley, peas, lentils and other early plant species started on a large scale. Seasonal planting cycles allowed people to produce food all year round.\n\n3.
