This includes professors, researchers, authors and theologians from various religious backgrounds and institutions worldwide. Furthermore, new scholars enter the field regularly while others retire or pass away.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that there are varying degrees of expertise among these scholars. Some may have a vast knowledge of multiple areas related to the New Testament (such as history, archaeology, and linguistics), while others might specialize in a particular aspect (like textual criticism or early Christian theology)."
