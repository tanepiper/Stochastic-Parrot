        "content": "There are a few different ways to clarify stock, but the most common method is known as \"rafting.\" This technique involves using egg whites and/or a combination of ground meats, mirepoix (a mix of onions, carrots and celery), and herbs to attract impurities in the liquid. The process is as follows:\n\n1. Cool your stock: Make sure your stock has been strained through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth or paper towel initially to remove any larger particles. Then let it cool until it's lukewarm.\n\n2. Skim off fat: Once cooled, carefully skim off any fat that may have risen to the surface with a spoon or ladle.\n\n3. Prepare clarification ingredients: Whisk 3-4 egg whites per gallon of stock until frothy but not whipped into peaks; set aside. Some chefs also prefer adding finely chopped meat and mirepoix for more flavor extraction during this process.\n\n4. Apply raft mixture: Gently whisk the beaten egg whites into the cooled liquid - making sure they don't cook immediately due to residual heat from earlier steps - creating an even mixture throughout the pot.\n\n5a.Take time incorporating raft material gradually allowing proteins/impurities/coagulants present within first addition chance sufficiently at forming stable network structures upon which new captures can take place while foaming/agitating mass increases boosting overall contact interface area between two substances significantly enhancing removal rates achieved whereby dissolved substance ratio decreases across successive iterations without suffering slumping instability issues\n\n6.Once bound together completely merely consuming separate increments helps avoid breaking apart thus preventing re-release back again at increasing equilibrium levels causing lowered efficacy wasting resources wasted-product spent-waste exhausted-resource depletion destruction elimination bad worse worsen forget worry fail FEAR respect"
