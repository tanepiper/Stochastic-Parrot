Identify the purpose and objectives of your app: Start by defining what you want your app to accomplish, who is the target audience, and how it will benefit them.\n\n2. Research competitors and similar apps: Study the features, design elements, and user experiences of existing apps in your market or sector.\n\n3. Select a development platform: Choose between native (iOS/Android), hybrid or web technologies depending on factors like cost, required expertise, performance expectations etc.\n\n4. Create an outline or wireframe (a visual representation) of your app: Plan out all screens, navigation components & features based on user flow diagrams using tools like Balsamiq Mockups or Sketch for visualization purposes.\n\n5. Design User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX): Design the look-and-feel of your application while focusing on ease-of-use following best practices in Mobile App Design Guidelines such as Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for iOS Apps / Google Material Design for Android Apps accordingly.\n\n6. Develop backend infrastructure if needed: Set up databases/servers/APIs as per requirements specified earlier during feature planning stage e.g., hosting service providers like AWS or Firebase can be used here along with cloud storage services/SDKs integration if any external data access/storage management becomes essential part this process\n\n7.Background coding/development phase begins now where experienced developers implement functionality through various programming languages & Software Development Kits(SDK) respective their chosen platforms/devices/browsers considering limitation imposed due compatibility issues across diverse ecosystems present today smartphone world too importantly debugging minor glitches iteratively perfecting codebase point deemed fit launch release beta testing followed Quality Assurance_testing done completion aspect refers making sure content matches designs final prototype"
