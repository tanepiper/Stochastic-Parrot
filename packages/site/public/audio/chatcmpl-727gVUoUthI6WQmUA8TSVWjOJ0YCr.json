In other words, it reflects the belief that any observed differences are merely due to noise or randomness, rather than an actual substantive difference.\n\nOn the other hand, an alternative hypothesis is its opposite: it represents the idea that there is a true difference between two groups or datasets due to factors outside of random chance. It serves as a testable claim and acts in opposition to the null hypothesis.\n\nPut simply:\n\n1. Null Hypothesis (H0): Assumes no significant difference exists.\n2. Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Assumes there might be a relevant (statistically significant) difference worth exploring further through testing."
