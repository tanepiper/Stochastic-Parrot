Additionally, the concept of transforming into a bird falls within the realms of mythology and fantasy rather than real-world physics.\n\nHowever, considering hypothetical examples in literature or media (e.g., shapeshifting witches or magical creatures), we could attempt a rough estimation using an energy measure like calories.\n\n1. If you are turning into an avian species similar in size to your human form(i.e., mass remains constant):\n\nSince one main difference between humans and birds lies in their musculoskeletal structure adaptation for flight, there will be some reorganization/control redistribution among their body constituents that incur additional energy expenditure during work up\n\nAssuming 6 hrs activity with MET value ranging from 3(for slow hovering) - 12(for flapping wings)[source: American college sports Medicine] , daily calorie intake needed would easily range around: \n\n- Basal rate :1500 kcal\n- Activity boost: Extra (8 x1200 +4x250)/2 = 5800 Kcal/day\n\n\nKeep this source of energy checked by eating an adequate quantity rich in high-calorie food throughout.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nThese numbers represent purely speculative estimations based on fun thought experiments and do not hold any scientific weight regarding actual consequences/effects observed during transformation practices(if existed)."
