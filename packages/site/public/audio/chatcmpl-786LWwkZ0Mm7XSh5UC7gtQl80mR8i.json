Get permission: First and foremost, it's essential to have that person's consent before attempting to access their search history.\n\n2. Access their device: Borrow or have access to the individual's device (smartphone or computer) they use for Google searches.\n\n3. Open a web browser (preferably Chrome): On their device, launch a web browser (ideally Google Chrome).\n\n4. Log in with their credentials: Assuming they are logged into their Google account on the respective device, open www.google.com/history. If prompted for login information, enter the appropriate email address and password linked with that user’s Google Account.\n\n5. Browse through their search activity: Once logged in successfully, you'll be able to see an organized list of all searches conducted by them within the specified timeframe.\n\nPlease remember it is vital only to do this if you have explicit permission from the person whose data you are accessing — unauthorized tracking of someone's online activities without consent would be considered privacy invasion and potentially illegal depending on your jurisdiction.\n"
