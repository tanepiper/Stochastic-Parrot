Simple inventions can be developed in a matter of weeks or months, while more complex inventions can take years of research, development, testing, and refinement.\n\nThe process typically follows these steps:\n\n1. Idea conception: This is the stage where you come up with the invention idea.\n\n2. Research: Once you have an idea, it's crucial to research its feasibility and possible demand in the market. This helps you understand if your invention has potential for success.\n\n3. Prototype development: If your research indicates that your idea has potential, start building a prototype or a model of your invention that demonstrates its functionality.\n\n4. Patent application: It's important to protect your intellectual property by filing for patent protection as soon as possible.\n\n5. Refinement and further development: Once you have a prototype and patent protection in place, continue refining your design to improve functionality or solve any issues that arise during testing.\n\n6. Production and manufacturing: Final"
