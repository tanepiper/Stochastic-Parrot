Essentially, if someone dies as a result of their involvement with an unlawful and inherently dangerous activity (like armed robbery), they may be held responsible for felony murder even if their role was tangential, accessory or nonviolent.\n\nNote: This answer addresses U.S. law; other jurisdictions may have different rules regarding felony murder."
