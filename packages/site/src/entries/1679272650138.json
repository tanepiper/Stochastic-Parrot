Use the web version: Simply visit https://web.telegram.org/ in Google Chrome or any web browser of your choice, log in with your phone number and enjoy using Telegram.\n\n2. Install the Android app (for compatible devices): Some newer Chromebooks have support for Android apps through the Google Play Store. If this is available on your device follow these steps:\n   a) Open up the Google Play Store.\n   b) Search for \"Telegram\".\n   c) Install Telegram X or Telegram Messenger from by clicking 'Install'.\n   d) After installation, open and sign-in using your phone number.\n\nNow you're ready to chat away!"
