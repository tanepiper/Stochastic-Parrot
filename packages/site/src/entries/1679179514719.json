It was originally built by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus around 27 BC-14 AD and later reconstructed by Emperor Hadrian about 126 AD. The Pantheon is known for its well-preserved architecture, massive Corinthian columns at the entrance, and remarkable dome with an open central oculus allowing light to enter.\n\nToday, it serves as both a church and a historic monument where important figures such as Italian kings Victor Emmanuel II and Umberto I are buried alongside noted painter Raphael."
